Here, we draw on two concepts from the political science literature to explore subtler strategies for government media manipulation: agenda-setting (selecting what topics to cover) and framing (deciding how topics are covered). We analyze 13 years (100K articles) of the Russian newspaper Izvestia and identify a strategy of distraction: articles mention the U.S. more frequently in the month directly following an economic downturn in Russia. We introduce embedding-based methods for cross-lingually projecting English frames to Russian, and discover that these articles emphasize U.S. moral failings and threats to the U.S. Our work offers new ways to identify subtle media manipulation strategies at the intersection of agenda-setting and framing. </p></section></p><div class="article-part article-body"><section id="1Introduction" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#1Introduction">

			                <p> Authoritarian countries such as Russia and China have received a great deal of attention for trying to control and distort the spread of information through “fake news” and censorship. However, authoritarian governments might also use subtle tactics of media manipulation that are much harder to detect, like flooding communication channels with irrelevant information or highlighting particular viewpoints of an event to distract public attention (Rozenas and Stukal, Forthcoming; Munger et al., 2018; King et al., 2017). “Fake news” can be identified by fact checkers. Censorship can be detected by checking what content is no longer available. However, we have no systematic way of identifying more subtle forms of media manipulation. To date, research has been limited to occasional leaks to reveal ground truth data (King et al., 2017). This paper proposes techniques— grounded in economics and political science— to automatically identify subtle manipulation at scale, and applies these techniques to study Russian media. These subtle manipulation strategies can be understood through agenda-setting—selecting what topics to cover—and framing—how aspects of those topics are highlighted to promote particular interpretations (Entman, 2007; Ghanem and McCombs, 2001). For example, abortion can be framed in terms of the life of a child or a woman’s freedom of choice (Tankard Jr, 2001). Agenda-setting and framing can have a significant influence on public opinion by attending to particular issues at the exclusion of others (McCombs, 2002; Boydstun et al., 2013). Both concepts have been well-studied in Englishspeaking democratic countries, but understudied in other settings. Here, we apply these concepts to the study of media manipulation in Russia, particularly as strategies of an autocratic regime. We focus on Russia, because of intense interest in the way Russia is shaping the global information environment (Van Herpen, 2015). Many Russian media outlets are state-owned or heavily influenced by the government. We focus on news coverage from 2003–2016 in one of the most widely-read newspapers in Russia: Izvestia. Despite a brief period of autonomy, Izvestia has become strongly influenced by the government (Jones, 2002). Prior work has identified a relationship between negative economic performance in Russia, such as stock market declines, and “selection attribution” in state-controlled media outlets, where negative events are blamed on foreign officials while positive events are credited to domestic officials (Rozenas and Stukal, Forthcoming). We build on these findings and investigate the relationship between economic performance, including that of the Russia Trading System Index (RTSI) and gross arXiv:1808.09386v1 [cs.CL] 28 Aug 2018 domestic product (GDP), and news coverage of foreign events. We primarily investigate coverage of the United States because Russia has seen the U.S. as its main rival since the Cold War, and we expect news coverage of foreign events to focus disproportionally on the U.S. We first establish a strong negative correlation between Russia’s economic situation and the proportion of news focused on the U.S. (§2). We then show that the correlation is directed: economic indicators precede (and thereby Granger-cause) the increase in foreign news coverage (§2.2). We consider this a clear case of agenda-setting. We then investigate how these news articles frame the U.S. We develop a distant supervision method to project English framing annotations onto our Russian corpus (§3), and draw on the projected frames to analyze manipulation strategies in news about the U.S. (§5). The contributions of this work are manifold: we show how framing and agenda-setting (concepts traditionally applied to policy debates) can be used to understand media manipulation strategies; we use economic metrics to automate the identification of agenda-setting; we devise a novel method for cross-lingual projection of framing annotations; and we use these annotations to show how agenda-setting is realized. </p></div>

			                <p> All media outlets inevitably use a form of agenda-setting: deciding what is “newsworthy” by covering some topics at the exclusion of others. Agenda-setting can powerfully sway the focus of public opinion (McCombs, 2002). We hypothesize that in countries with weak democratic institutions and in particular, with state-controlled media, the government may actively use agendasetting to shape public opinion. We observe this phenomenon by comparing how much Russian newspapers describe the U.S. and the state of the Russian economy. We then use Granger-causality to show that a decline the Russian stock market is followed by an increase in U.S. news coverage. Our results are based on a corpus of over 100,000 articles from the newspaper Izvestia published in 2003–2016 (see Appendix A for details). </p></div>

                        <p> We compared the salience of news focused on the U.S. with indicators that reflect the economic state of Russia to test our hypothesis: that news coverage of the U.S. is used to distract the public from negative economic events. We first performed an initial, simplistic study of this agenda-setting strategy. We define U.S. coverage as the ratio of Izvestia articles that mention the U.S. at least twice to the total number of articles in any given time slice (in our initial study, a year). We show in Figure 1 the U.S. coverage plotted against Russian GDP, in an annual resolution. We find a strong negative Pearson’s correlation (r=- 0.83): mentions of the U.S. in Izvestia increase as economic indicators deteriorate. The one exception to this trend is 2008, during which there was a high amount of U.S. news coverage and the Russian GDP peaked. This year coincides with both the U.S. financial crisis and the ObamaMcCain Presidential election, which would explain a focus on U.S. events regardless of the Russian economic situation. U.S. coverage, measured by counting mentions of the U.S. in Izvestia, is inversely related to the level of the Russian GDP. This negative correlation indicates the possibility of intentional agendasetting by the Russian government. Figure 1: Proportion of articles that mention the U.S. at least twice (blue) and Russian GDP (red), 2003–2016. We now extend these preliminary results in several ways. First, we refine the definition of U.S. coverage by using two metrics: article level, the number of articles that mention the U.S. at least twice normalized by the total number of articles in the time slice; and word level, the frequency of the occurrences of the U.S., normalized by the total number of words in the time slice. Second, we compare these metrics to two economic indicators: GDP (in USD) and the index of the Russian stock market (RTSI), in rubles.1 Third, we refine the time-resolution and use yearly, quarterly, and monthly time slices. Table 1 reports the correlations between the two metrics of U.S. coverage and (monthly, quarterly, and yearly) RTSI and GDP values. At all levels, there are strong negative correlations between the proportion of news focused on the U.S. and economic state. Level: Article Word RTSI (Monthly, rubles) -0.54 -0.52 GDP (Quarterly, USD) -0.69 -0.65 GDP (Yearly, USD) -0.83 -0.79 Table 1: Pearson’s correlation between news coverage of the U.S. and economic indicators. </p><figure data-equation="" data-image="11" data-figure-category="figure" data-caption="" id="F9687771" data-image-src="/media/images/ec316ac1-530d-43a5-8828-c187a79cfc8e.png"><div><img src="ec316ac1-530d-43a5-8828-c187a79cfc8e.png"/></div><figcaption><span class="figure-cat-figure" data-figure-category="figure">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><figure data-equation="" data-image="12" data-figure-category="figure" data-caption="" id="F91231931" data-image-src="/media/images/649a5214-5b25-44ac-bffd-6e1e4fa61d9b.png"><div><img src="649a5214-5b25-44ac-bffd-6e1e4fa61d9b.png"/></div><figcaption><span class="figure-cat-figure" data-figure-category="figure">figure 2: </span></figcaption></figure></section><section id="2.2GrangerCausality" inlist="" resource="#2.2GrangerCausality">

                        <p>Next, we hypothesize that these correlations are in fact directed: a change in the economy is followed by a change in U.S. news coverage. To investigate this hypothesis we employ Granger causality (Granger, 1988). The key concept behind Granger causality is that cause precedes effect. Thus, a time series X is said to Granger-cause a times series Y if past values xt−i are significant indicators in predicting yt . First, we computed the article-level (at) and word-level (wt) metrics at a monthly granularity from 2003 to 2016; we also extracted the RTSI monthly close price (in rubles) for the same time period (rt). We then calculated the percentage change of these series as: C(wt) = wt wt−1 −1, and equivalently calculated C(at) and C(rt). By taking the percent change of both series, we control for long term trends (e.g., stock markets tend to trend upwards over time), and instead focus on short-term relations: does a change in the economy directly precede a change in news coverage? We computed Granger causality between C(wt) and C(rt) by fitting a linear regression model: C(wt) = Xm i=1 αi(C(wt−i)) + Xn j=1 βj (C(rt−j )) where m and n denote how far back in time we look (denoted as m-lag or n-lag). We can say that rt Granger-causes wt if we find that β is significantly different from zero. 1 Stock market values were obtained from the Moscow exchange website. GDP values were obtained from OECD. Tables 2 and 3 report the results. A p-value ≤ 0.05 indicates significance; thus we find 1-lag RTSI values Granger-cause coverage of U.S. news by both the word-level and article-level metrics. Importantly, the rt−1 coefficient is negative, which indicates that a decline in the stock market is followed by an increase in U.S. news coverage. In the 2-lag analysis, the rt−2 values are not significant, which suggests that the changes in news coverage follow changes in the stock market within one month.2 For completeness, we also computed Granger causality in the reverse direction: i.e., does a change in U.S. news coverage Granger-cause a change in the stock market? As expected, we found no significant results. 1-Lag 2-Lag α; β p-Value α; β p-Value wt−1 -0.233 0.003 -0.320 0.00005 wt−2 - - -0.301 0.0001 rt−1 -0.352 0.0334 -0.369 0.024 rt−2 - - -0.122 0.458 Table 2: Granger causality between % change in RTSI and frequency of USA (word level). 1-Lag 2-Lag α; β p-Value α; β p-Value at−1 -0.222 0.005 -0.290 0.000289 at−2 - - -0.270 0.000634 rt−1 -0.311 0.035 -0.329 0.0267 rt−2 - - -0.091 0.543 Table 3: Granger causality between % change in RTSI and frequency of USA (article level). </p></section><section id="3FramingAnalysis" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#3FramingAnalysis">

                        <p> While agenda-setting broadly refers to what topics a text covers, framing refers to which attributes of those topics are highlighted. Several aspects of framing make the concept difficult to analyze. First, just defining framing has been “notoriously slippery” (Boydstun et al., 2013). Frames can occur as stock phrases, i.e. “death tax” vs. “estate tax”, but they can also occur as broader associations or sub-topics (Tsur et al., 2015; McCombs, 2002). Frames also need to be distinguished from similar concepts, like sentiment and stance. For example, the same frame can be used to take different stances on an issue: one politician might argue that immigrants boost the economy by starting new companies that create jobs, while another might argue that immigrants hurt the economy by taking jobs away from U.S. citizens (Baumer et al., 2015; Gamson and Modigliani, 1989). Finally, unlike classification tasks where each article is assigned to a single category, most articles employ a variety of frames (Ghanem and McCombs, 2001). Recent work has attempted to address these conceptual challenges by defining broad framing categories. The Policy Frames Codebook defines a set of 15 frames (one of which is “Other”) commonly used in media for a broad range of issues (Boydstun et al., 2013). In a follow-up work, the authors use these frames to build The Media Frames Corpus (MFC), which consists of articles related to 3 issues: immigration, tobacco, and same-sex marriage (Card et al., 2015). About 11,900 articles are hand-annotated with frames: annotators highlight spans of text related to each frame in the codebook and assign a single “primary frame” to each document. However, the MFC, like other prior framing analyses, relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotations. The primary automated methods have relied on probabilistic topic models (Tsur et al., 2015; Boydstun et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2013). Although topic models can show researchers what themes are salient in a corpus, they have two main drawbacks: they tend to be corpus-specific and hard to interpret. Topics discovered in one corpus are likely not relevant to a different corpus, and it is difficult to compare the outputs of topic models run on different corpora. Other automated framing analyses have used the annotations of the Media Frame Corpus to predict the primary frame of articles (Card et al., 2016; Ji and Smith, 2017), or used classifiers to identify language specifically related to framing (Baumer et al., 2015). Importantly, all of these methods focus exclusively on English data sets. While unsupervised methods like topic models can be applied to other languages, any supervised method requires annotated data, which does not exist in other languages. </p></section><section id="3.2FramingAnalysisMethodology" inlist="" resource="#3.2FramingAnalysisMethodology">
                            <h3 property="schema:name">3.2 Framing Analysis Methodology </h3>
                        <p>Our goal is to develop a method that is easy to interpret and applicable across-languages. In order to ensure our analysis is interpretable, we ground our method using the annotations of the Media Frames Corpus. However, because the MFC is entirely in English and our test corpora is in Russian, we cannot use a fully supervised method. Instead, we use the MFC annotations to derive lexicons for each frame, which we then translate into Russian. We use query-expansion to reduce the noisiness of machine translation and make the lexicons specific to the Izvestia corpus, rather than specific to the MFC. We evaluate the derived lexicons in English and in Russian. Finally, we use these lexicons to analyze frames in Izvestia and identify strategies of media manipulation. Our method allows for in-depth analysis by identifying primary and secondary frames in a document and specific words that signify frames. </p><p><strong>Generating framing lexicons</strong> Although our primary test corpus is in Russian, we also use English test corpora for evaluation; thus, we describe our method as applicable to either language. First, we use the MFC annotations to derive a lexicon of English words related to each frame in the Policy Frames Codebook. For a given frame F we measure pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990) for each word in the corpus as: I(F, w) = log P(F, w) P(F)P(w) = logP(w | F) P(w) We estimate P(w|F) by taking all text segments annotated with frame F, and computing Count(w) Count(allwords) . We similarly compute P(w) from the entire corpus. We then use the 250 words with the highest I(w, F) as the base framing lexicon for frame F, denoted Fbase. We discard all words that occur in fewer than 0.5% of documents or in more than 98% of documents. </p><p><strong>Translation and extension of framing lexicons</strong> Next, we use query-expansion to alter Fbase, with the goal of generalizing the lexicon. Without this step, our lexicons are biased towards words common in English news articles, particularly words specific to the 3 policy issues in the MFC. When our test corpus is in a different language (i.e. Russian), we use Google Translate to translate Fbase into the new language. We restrict our vocabulary to the 50,000 most frequent words in the test corpus. Then, to perform the query-expansion, we train 200-dimensional word embeddings on a large background corpus in the test language, using CBOW with a 5-word context window (Mikolov et al., 2013). We compute the center of each lexicon, c, by summing the embeddings for all words in the lexicon. We then identify up to the K nearest neighbors to this center, determined by the cosine distance from c, as long as the cosine distance is not greater than a manually-chosen threshold (t).3 We again filtered the final set by removing all words that occur in fewer than 0.5% of documents or in more than 98% of documents. The final lexicons contain between 100 and 300 words per frame. Table 4 depicts a few examples of lexicon words extracted from the MFC, and words in our final lexicons. We can observe that words in Frus are closely related to words in Fbase, but also specific to Russian culture and politics. We consider a document to employ a frame F if the document contains at least 3 instances of a word from F’s lexicon. We assign the primary frame of a document to be its most common frame, determined by the number of words from each framing lexicon in the document .4 3When the test corpus is in English, we set t to 0.4 and K to 500 and we add the identified neighbors to Fbase. When our test corpus is in Russian, we choose to discard our base lexicon, to prevent the final lexicons from being too U.S.-specific. Instead, we set t to 0.3 and K to 1000, which increases the number of neighbors identified, and we keep only these neighbors in the final lexicon. 4We do not generate a lexicon for the “Other” frame, and instead assign a document’s primary frame as “Other” only if it does not contain at least 3 words from any framing lexicon. Throughout this process, we use small subsets of the “tobacco” articles for parameter tuning.

			                <p>We can evaluate the English lexicons using annotated data from the MFC. For the Russian lexicons, since we do not have annotated Russian data, we instead conduct an annotation task. These evaluation metrics determine how well our method captures which frames are present in a text. Finally, we also qualitatively compare our method to existing methods for framing analysis, specifically topic models. </p><p><strong>English Evaluations</strong> We first evaluate our lexicons on two tasks using the MFC annotations: primary frame identification and identification of all frames in a document. Primary frame identification is a 15-class classification problem. Two prior studies evaluate models on this task: Card et al. (2016) and Ji and Smith (2017). Following these studies, we evaluate our model using 10-fold cross-validation on only the “Immigration” subset of the MFC. We use 9 folds to generate framing lexicons and the 10th fold to evaluate. To train word embeddings, we use the entire MFC corpus combined with over 1 million New York Times articles from 1986 - 2016 (Fast and Horvitz, 2017). Table 5 shows the accuracy of our model. Our results outperform Card et al. (2016) and are comparable to Ji and Smith (2017). Furthermore, unlike prior methods, our method is able to transfer to different domains and languages without needing further annotated data. Ji and Smith (2017) 58.4 Card et al. (2016) 56.8 Our model 57.3 Table 5: Accuracy of primary frame classification. However, our main interest is in measuring the salience of frames in general, not merely focusing on the primary frame. Thus, we also use our lexicons to identify the presence of any frames in a document. As the MFC has multiple annotators, we define a frame to be present in a document if any annotator identified the frame, and use this as gold standard test data. In evaluating our lexicons, we consider a frame to be present in a document if the document contains at least 3 tokens from the frame’s lexicon. To the best of our knowledge, identifying all frames in a document is a new task that was not attempted in prior work. Thus, we use a logistic regression model with bag-of-word features as a standard baseline. As above, we evaluate using 10-fold cross validation on the “Immigration” subset of the MFC. Table 6 shows that our method outperforms the baseline, with the exception of 2 frames, even though the baseline is fully supervised, whereas our method is distantly supervised. We note that the poorest performing frames, “External Regulation and Reputation” and “Morality” are the frames which are least common in this subset of the data – each frame occurs in fewer than 500 articles. When we run the same 10- fold cross validation evaluation on the “Samesex” subsection of the MFC, where the “Morality” frame occurs in over 1000 articles, we achieve a higher F1 score (0.65). Ours Baseline Capacity &amp; Resources 0.53 0.48 Crime &amp; Punishment 0.78 0.76 Cultural Identity 0.57 0.62 Economic 0.69 0.67 External Regulation 0.25 0.47 Fairness &amp; Equality 0.50 0.44 Health &amp; Safety 0.58 0.53 Legality &amp; Constitutionality 0.80 0.76 Morality 0.31 0.25 Policy Prescription 0.72 0.69 Political 0.80 0.77 Public Sentiment 0.54 0.47 Quality of Life 0.65 0.63 Security &amp; Defense 0.63 0.63 Table 6: F1 Scores for identification of all frames in a document. </p><p><strong>Russian Evaluations</strong> Next, we evaluate the quality of our method on the Russian data set. Unlike in English, we do not have frameannotated data in Russian. We instead performed the intruder detection task, an established method for evaluating topic models (Chang et al., 2009). For each frame F we randomly sampled 5 words from the framing lexicon Frus and 1 word from the lexicon of a different frame, which has no overlap with Frus. We then presented two (native Russian speaking) annotators with the frame heading and the set of 6 words, and asked them to choose which word did not belong in the set. We evaluated 15 sets or 75 words per frame. Framing can be subjective, and we do not necessarily expect annotators to interpret frames in the same way. We calculate two forms of accuracy: “soft”, whether any annotator correctly identified the intruder; and “hard”, whether both did. We also report average precision as defined in (Chang et al., 2009), i.e. the average number of annotators that correctly identified the intruder, averaged across all sets. We briefly summarize results here and report them fully in Appendix B. All accuracies are significantly better than random guessing, and no soft accuracy falls below 60%. Only two frames have an average accuracy ≤ 60%, “Fairness and Equality” and “Morality”, both very abstract concepts. In these frames, we also see a larger difference between hard and soft accuracies, which reflects the subjectivity of framing. The MFC annotators sometimes disagreed on the correct annotations, even after discussing their disagreements (Boydstun et al., 2013). Thus, we can attribute some of the differences between hard and soft accuracies to this subjectivity. </p><p><strong>Qualitative Comparison to Structured Topic Models</strong> We also qualitatively compared the information our framing lexicons provide with information provided by a Structured Topic Model (STM) (Roberts et al., 2013). We find that our approach is better able to capture frames the way a reader might conceptualize them, whereas topic models are useful for finding fine-grained corpusspecific topics. Topic models are a common way to analyze frames in a text (Nguyen et al., 2013); the STM specifically allows correlation between topics and covariates. We trained an STM with 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 topics on U.S.-focused articles in the Izvestia corpus, including publication date (month and year) as a covariate. We selected the 20 topic model as having the most coherent topics. Throughout this section, we refer to topics using their most representative words as determined by the “Lift” metric (Roberts et al., 2013).</p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">(Baumer, Elovic, Qin, Polletta, &amp; Gay, 2015)</span><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:2485457072}]">(Boydstun, Gross, Resnik, &amp; Smith, 2013)</span></p></div>
