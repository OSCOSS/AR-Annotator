We hypothesize that in countries with weak democratic institutions and in particular, with state-controlled media, the government may actively use agendasetting to shape public opinion. We observe this phenomenon by comparing how much Russian newspapers describe the U.S. and the state of the Russian economy. We then use Granger-causality to show that a decline the Russian stock market is followed by an increase in U.S. news coverage.

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#4EvaluationofFramingLexicons> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>We can evaluate the English lexicons using annotated data from the MFC. For the Russian lexicons, since we do not have annotated Russian data, we instead conduct an annotation task. These evaluation metrics determine how well our method captures which frames are present in a text. Finally, we also qualitatively compare our method to existing methods for framing analysis, specifically topic models. </p><p><strong>English Evaluations</strong> We first evaluate our lexicons on two tasks using the MFC annotations: primary frame identification and identification of all frames in a document. Primary frame identification is a 15-class classification problem. Two prior studies evaluate models on this task: Card et al. (2016) and Ji and Smith (2017). Following these studies, we evaluate our model using 10-fold cross-validation on only the \u201CImmigration\u201D subset of the MFC. We use 9 folds to generate framing lexicons and the 10th fold to evaluate. To train word embeddings, we use the entire MFC corpus combined with over 1 million New York Times articles from 1986 - 2016 (Fast and Horvitz, 2017). Table 5 shows the accuracy of our model. Our results outperform Card et al. (2016) and are comparable to Ji and Smith (2017). Furthermore, unlike prior methods, our method is able to transfer to different domains and languages without needing further annotated data. Ji and Smith (2017) 58.4 Card et al. (2016) 56.8 Our model 57.3 Table 5: Accuracy of primary frame classification. However, our main interest is in measuring the salience of frames in general, not merely focusing on the primary frame. Thus, we also use our lexicons to identify the presence of any frames in a document. As the MFC has multiple annotators, we define a frame to be present in a document if any annotator identified the frame, and use this as gold standard test data. In evaluating our lexicons, we consider a frame to be present in a document if the document contains at least 3 tokens from the frame\u2019s lexicon. To the best of our knowledge, identifying all frames in a document is a new task that was not attempted in prior work. Thus, we use a logistic regression model with bag-of-word features as a standard baseline. As above, we evaluate using 10-fold cross validation on the \u201CImmigration\u201D subset of the MFC. Table 6 shows that our method outperforms the baseline, with the exception of 2 frames, even though the baseline is fully supervised, whereas our method is distantly supervised. We note that the poorest performing frames, \u201CExternal Regulation and Reputation\u201D and \u201CMorality\u201D are the frames which are least common in this subset of the data \u2013 each frame occurs in fewer than 500 articles. When we run the same 10- fold cross validation evaluation on the \u201CSamesex\u201D subsection of the MFC, where the \u201CMorality\u201D frame occurs in over 1000 articles, we achieve a higher F1 score (0.65). Ours Baseline Capacity &amp; Resources 0.53 0.48 Crime &amp; Punishment 0.78 0.76 Cultural Identity 0.57 0.62 Economic 0.69 0.67 External Regulation 0.25 0.47 Fairness &amp; Equality 0.50 0.44 Health &amp; Safety 0.58 0.53 Legality &amp; Constitutionality 0.80 0.76 Morality 0.31 0.25 Policy Prescription 0.72 0.69 Political 0.80 0.77 Public Sentiment 0.54 0.47 Quality of Life 0.65 0.63 Security &amp; Defense 0.63 0.63 Table 6: F1 Scores for identification of all frames in a document. </p><p><strong>Russian Evaluations</strong> Next, we evaluate the quality of our method on the Russian data set. Unlike in English, we do not have frameannotated data in Russian. We instead performed the intruder detection task, an established method for evaluating topic models (Chang et al., 2009). For each frame F we randomly sampled 5 words from the framing lexicon Frus and 1 word from the lexicon of a different frame, which has no overlap with Frus. We then presented two (native Russian speaking) annotators with the frame heading and the set of 6 words, and asked them to choose which word did not belong in the set. We evaluated 15 sets or 75 words per frame. Framing can be subjective, and we do not necessarily expect annotators to interpret frames in the same way. We calculate two forms of accuracy: \u201Csoft\u201D, whether any annotator correctly identified the intruder; and \u201Chard\u201D, whether both did. We also report average precision as defined in (Chang et al., 2009), i.e. the average number of annotators that correctly identified the intruder, averaged across all sets. We briefly summarize results here and report them fully in Appendix B. All accuracies are significantly better than random guessing, and no soft accuracy falls below 60%. Only two frames have an average accuracy \u2264 60%, \u201CFairness and Equality\u201D and \u201CMorality\u201D, both very abstract concepts. In these frames, we also see a larger difference between hard and soft accuracies, which reflects the subjectivity of framing. The MFC annotators sometimes disagreed on the correct annotations, even after discussing their disagreements (Boydstun et al., 2013). Thus, we can attribute some of the differences between hard and soft accuracies to this subjectivity. </p><p><strong>Qualitative Comparison to Structured Topic Models</strong> We also qualitatively compared the information our framing lexicons provide with information provided by a Structured Topic Model (STM) (Roberts et al., 2013). We find that our approach is better able to capture frames the way a reader might conceptualize them, whereas topic models are useful for finding fine-grained corpusspecific topics. Topic models are a common way to analyze frames in a text (Nguyen et al., 2013); the STM specifically allows correlation between topics and covariates. We trained an STM with 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 topics on U.S.-focused articles in the Izvestia corpus, including publication date (month and year) as a covariate. We selected the 20 topic model as having the most coherent topics. Throughout this section, we refer to topics using their most representative words as determined by the \u201CLift\u201D metric (Roberts et al., 2013).</p><p><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]\">(Baumer, Elovic, Qin, Polletta, &amp; Gay, 2015)</span><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:2485457072}]\">(Boydstun, Gross, Resnik, &amp; Smith, 2013)</span></p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

We analyze 13 years (100K articles) of the Russian newspaper Izvestia and identify a strategy of distraction: articles mention the U.S. more frequently in the month directly following an economic downturn in Russia.

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p> Authoritarian countries such as Russia and China have received a great deal of attention for trying to control and distort the spread of information through \u201Cfake news\u201D and censorship. However, authoritarian governments might also use subtle tactics of media manipulation that are much harder to detect, like flooding communication channels with irrelevant information or highlighting particular viewpoints of an event to distract public attention (Rozenas and Stukal, Forthcoming; Munger et al., 2018; King et al., 2017). \u201CFake news\u201D can be identified by fact checkers. Censorship can be detected by checking what content is no longer available. However, we have no systematic way of identifying more subtle forms of media manipulation. To date, research has been limited to occasional leaks to reveal ground truth data (King et al., 2017). This paper proposes techniques\u2014 grounded in economics and political science\u2014 to automatically identify subtle manipulation at scale, and applies these techniques to study Russian media. These subtle manipulation strategies can be understood through agenda-setting\u2014selecting what topics to cover\u2014and framing\u2014how aspects of those topics are highlighted to promote particular interpretations (Entman, 2007; Ghanem and McCombs, 2001). For example, abortion can be framed in terms of the life of a child or a woman\u2019s freedom of choice (Tankard Jr, 2001). Agenda-setting and framing can have a significant influence on public opinion by attending to particular issues at the exclusion of others (McCombs, 2002; Boydstun et al., 2013). Both concepts have been well-studied in Englishspeaking democratic countries, but understudied in other settings. Here, we apply these concepts to the study of media manipulation in Russia, particularly as strategies of an autocratic regime. We focus on Russia, because of intense interest in the way Russia is shaping the global information environment (Van Herpen, 2015). Many Russian media outlets are state-owned or heavily influenced by the government. We focus on news coverage from 2003\u20132016 in one of the most widely-read newspapers in Russia: Izvestia. Despite a brief period of autonomy, Izvestia has become strongly influenced by the government (Jones, 2002). Prior work has identified a relationship between negative economic performance in Russia, such as stock market declines, and \u201Cselection attribution\u201D in state-controlled media outlets, where negative events are blamed on foreign officials while positive events are credited to domestic officials (Rozenas and Stukal, Forthcoming). We build on these findings and investigate the relationship between economic performance, including that of the Russia Trading System Index (RTSI) and gross arXiv:1808.09386v1 [cs.CL] 28 Aug 2018 domestic product (GDP), and news coverage of foreign events. We primarily investigate coverage of the United States because Russia has seen the U.S. as its main rival since the Cold War, and we expect news coverage of foreign events to focus disproportionally on the U.S. We first establish a strong negative correlation between Russia\u2019s economic situation and the proportion of news focused on the U.S. (\u00A72). We then show that the correlation is directed: economic indicators precede (and thereby Granger-cause) the increase in foreign news coverage (\u00A72.2). We consider this a clear case of agenda-setting. We then investigate how these news articles frame the U.S. We develop a distant supervision method to project English framing annotations onto our Russian corpus (\u00A73), and draw on the projected frames to analyze manipulation strategies in news about the U.S. (\u00A75). The contributions of this work are manifold: we show how framing and agenda-setting (concepts traditionally applied to policy debates) can be used to understand media manipulation strategies; we use economic metrics to automate the identification of agenda-setting; we devise a novel method for cross-lingual projection of framing annotations; and we use these annotations to show how agenda-setting is realized. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
