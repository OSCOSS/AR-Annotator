Nevertheless, especially in built and structured environments, current technologies and market solutions are often far from providing the required levels of automation, coordination and adaptivity. Devices should interact autonomously, should reach opportunistic decisions and take actions accordingly. In particular, user activities and profiles should be among the manifold implicit factors to be taken into account in that process. Home and Building Automation (HBA) is one of the most relevant scenarios suffering from the poorness of the allowed system intelligence, automation and adaptivity. Devices are logically associated through static profiles defined at system deployment stage. The large majority of solutions are proprietary and centralized, and require manual configuration. This paper proposes a novel semantic-based framework complying with the emerging Social Internet of Things paradigm. Infrastructured spaces can be intended as populated by device agents organized in social networks, interacting autonomously and sharing information, cooperating and orchestrating resources. A service-oriented architecture allows collaborative dissemination, discovery and composition of service/resource descriptions. Semantic Web languages are adopted as knowledge representation layer and mobile-oriented implementations of non-monotonic inferences for semantic matchmaking are used to give decision capabilities to software agents. Finally, the Linked Data Platform (LDP) over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) provides the knowledge organization and sharing infrastructure underpinning social object interactions. The framework has been implemented and tested in a home automation prototype integrating several communication protocols and off-the-shelf devices. Experiments advocate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></section></p><div class="article-part metadata article-keywords"><span class="keyword">Semantic Web of Things</span><span class="keyword"> Objects Social Networks</span><span class="keyword"> Building Automation</span><span class="keyword"> Linked Data Platform</span><span class="keyword"> Constrained Application Protocol</span></div><div class="article-part article-body"><section id="Introduction" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#Introduction">

			                <p>In the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) vision, built environments interact with their inhabitants in an “unobtrusive, interconnected, adaptable, dynamic, embedded and intelligent” way [44]. Personal requirements and preferences are grasped, deciphered and formalized as well as the environment can adapt to them, and even anticipate people’s needs and behaviors. The AmI 1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 c 0 – IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 M. Ruta et al. / Social IoT for Domotics: a Knowledge-based Approach over LDP-CoAP idea leverages technological progress in the Internet of Things (IoT), where large numbers of everyday objects are augmented with communication and computation capabilities. People in their usual environments are increasingly surrounded by networks of micro-devices, endowed with embedded sensors for data capture as well as processing units for deriving context information. To create real cohesive AmI, such devices should communicate and coordinate autonomously, making decisions dynamically based on manifold factors, including the state of surrounding objects and places as well as user activities and profiles. While traditional human-computer interaction has been explicit and mediated by input peripherals, in AmI implicit, effortless interaction paradigms predominate, where relevant information about users’ goals and intentions is inferred automatically by analyzing their actions and context, through sensors integrated in the environment or in wearable things. Current solutions for Home and Building Automation (HBA) are still far from the above levels of intelligence, automation and adaptivity. They grant limited flexibility, as devices are logically associated at the application level by means of static profiles, defined at system deployment stage. With most established HBA standards, changing the set of possible configurations or introducing new devices require the intervention of qualified practitioners. Recently, product manufacturers and system integrators have proposed more userfriendly “smart home” devices and platforms, leveraging the IoT [29]. Unfortunately, solutions are proprietary and centralized, and they still require manual configuration. This seemingly improved usability comes at the price of providing only very basic automation [30], typically using Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules on simplistic threshold or on/off conditions. Hence, significant technological advances are needed to fully accomplish the AmI vision. Flexible and meaningful relationships among devices in a given environment should be possible, established automatically to support articulate orchestration and coreography patterns. Recent research in the so-called Social Internet of Things (SIoT) [3] is starting to define models and architectures to reach this goal. Paradigms are often borrowed from Social Networking Services (SNS) for human users. If properly adapted to the peculiarities and requirements of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), they can support powerful approaches. SIoT offers several benefits and interesting perspectives for the IoT. The adoption of a social model for object interchange makes structured (to some extent) the intrinsically unpredictable interaction in the IoT and therefore it gives an unquestionable added-valued in terms of interoperability, autonomicity, versatility and coordination. This is done in such a way not imposing intolerable constraints to the fundamental flexibility and variability of Internet of Things scenarios and then not limiting a priori their peculiarities. This is not enough, however, for true AmI: versatile cooperation, organization and integration can be achieved only if connected things can represent, discover and share information and services described in an articulate way by means of high-level formalisms. Semantic Web technologies are natural candidates for such a role, as they provide interoperable languages and tools grounded on formal logic semantics [46]. Semantic Web standards enable knowledge modeling, assertion, organization, querying and inference in distributed systems, but technologies and tools require proper adaptation to work efficiently in resource-constrained environments like the IoT. The Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) [40] aims at the convergence of the Semantic Web and IoT visions, endowing environments with intelligence by means of semantic metadata dynamically produced by ubiquitous micro-devices to characterize sensor data, detected events and phenomena, objects, places and other relevant entities in a context. Due to the volatility and unpredictability of mobile and IoT environments, device and service discovery are two major challenges in the SWoT. Achieving acceptable performance also requires attention, as Semantic Web tools, protocols and languages are typically too resource-consuming for current IoT devices. Application-level protocols and reasoning tools for the (Semantic) Web must be properly adjusted, tailoring their feature set to pervasive computing contexts. This paper presents a possible approach for a Semantic Social Internet of Things grounded on Ambient Intelligence scenarios. According to the SWoT paradigm, standard technologies were adapted to provide a cohesive knowledge and service discovery architecture. The proposal leverages: i) the Linked Data Platform (LDP) [48] to annotate and organize information resources and ii) the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [10] –a proposed IETF1 standard RESTful protocol– for resource exchange in constrained environments, as it is more efficient than HTTP. Above this knowledge/service interoperabil1 Internet Engineering Task Force, https://www.ietf.org M. Ruta et al. / Social IoT for Domotics: a Knowledge-based Approach over LDP-CoAP 3 ity layer, a semantic-enhanced application level enables social networking among “agentified” things. Entities and operations in domotics and IoT scenarios are mapped to a novel social multi-agent serviceoriented architecture (SOA), supported by semanticbased capabilities. It should be noticed that the proposed framework addresses the specific needs of IoT systems both in terms of communication and computing standpoints, but also in terms of functional and/or architectural aspects. The proposed MAS is intrinsically general purpose and platform-independent in order to comply with a possible exploitation in different scenarios and contexts. Anyway, IoT constraints set the choice of a lightweight application protocol like CoAP (satisfying minimum functional requirements of a small device-oriented SN without excessive computational/bandwidth load at the application level), as well as they impose architectural and implementation choices devoted to keep under control the framework deployment in real-world micro-devices. This has been pursued through the adoption of compression strategies for language verbosity control, through the selection of a compact OWL syntax and via the targeted usage of both memory and data structures. Finally, the architectural approach followed aims to make modular and componentized the micro-SN fundamental elements in order to allow functional (high-level) properties to be enrolled on-demand following (low-level) device capabilities. Borrowing core relationships and structure from popular SNSs, devices enable specific interaction patterns for information sharing and cooperative decentralized service/resource discovery. Such selective choreography is triggered autonomously, based on the kind of managed resources and other contextual factors; this capability enhances interoperability across heterogeneous platforms and scalability in dense multi-agent environments. Resource discovery exploits semantic matchmaking between ontologybased annotations which describe requests and available resources. Non-standard, non-monotonic inferences [39] implemented in the Mini-ME mobile matchmaker and reasoner [45] allow supporting approximated matches, resource ranking and aggregation for covering complex requests. The framework also supports basic and legacy devices, which do not have computational power enough for on-board reasoning, by allowing them to select a more capable friend as inference facilitator. The general framework outlined above has been focused on smart HBA, to provide AmI experiences in residential and workplace settings. It was implemented and evaluated in a real prototypical testbed, encompassing diverse device types, communicating across different wired and wireless HBA protocols. Experimental evidences are reported and assess framework feasibility and effectiveness. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the state of the art, while the framework is described in detail in Section 3. Section 4 introduces basics of the Linked Data Platform over CoAP and details the developed testbed. Section 5 presents a case study to further clarify the proposal and its benefits. Experimental evaluations in Section 6 provide an assessment of both practicability and efficiency of the proposed approach, before conclusion. </p></div>

			                <p>In latest years, social networking services have changed personal interaction habits and relationships management on a global scale. Members of SNSs create personal profiles with basic information about themselves; connect with other users in either bidirectional (e.g., friendship, group) or unidirectional (e.g., follower) relationships; post text and/or multimedia items on their wall (i.e., log) for sharing with their contacts; flag (tag) some contacts to associate them and draw their attention to a certain element; respond to content published by other users with comments and reactions (e.g., like). SNS adopters generally manifest an intention to continue using them [34], because SNSs provide both utility (extrinsic value) and gratification (intrinsic value). Their usefulness also grows as they connect more users, and particularly complementary ones [34], since opportunities increase for discovering interesting information and services. A social evolution of pervasive computing [3] envisions objects acting as independent agents, capable of establishing relationships and using them to share information and services more effectively. This may allow to reap the above benefits in advanced IoT scenarios; actually, it is reasonable to expect them to be higher in large and heterogeneous networks, such as in HBA. An in-depth analysis of object social networks can be found in [49], which discussed key metrics about nodes and links by adapting from and expanding upon the social network analysis literature. Definitions were formalized in an ontology objects can use to manage their policies, friends and reputation. The fol- 4 M. Ruta et al. / Social IoT for Domotics: a Knowledge-based Approach over LDP-CoAP lowing differences exist w.r.t. the approach proposed in this paper: (i) both a symmetrical relationship (friend) and an asymmetrical one (follower) were modeled, whereas [49] includes only an asymmetrical friendship model; (ii) a reference ontology referring to several well-known Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies was developed in order to improve and facilitate the interoperability among different systems; (iii) non-standard inference services were exploited to support a semantic-enhanced resource discovery and composition in social environments. Further ontology proposals exist to formalize models of the social networking domain, e.g., [5]. Particularly, in [3], things engage with one another in social networks independently from human SNSs and from user interactions. A relevant case [37] included social object capabilities in control networks, aiming at distributed Web Ontology Language (OWL) Knowledge Base (KB) management and inference. When connecting to the network, every object proactively exchanged information with other devices in a handshake process. “Requester” devices, equipped with reasoning facilities, could then distribute queries automatically among “known” devices. Unfortunately, the adopted query language supported only very simple inferences, limiting the practical usefulness of the proposal. Another research direction has been focusing on the integration of the IoT into the social context of human users [5], either to improve adaptivity in AmI [27] or to monitor users and assist them in personalizing their SNS experience and interactions [36]. In [26] semantic-based situation detection and goal retrieval were used for matchmaking with task profiles to recommend activities to users, based on their current context. Unlike our approach, social interactions occurred only between devices and users; furthermore, adopted rule-based reasoning could not retrieve approximate matches when exact ones did not exist. A further effort to achieve social capabilities is object blogging, defined as an object’s capability of annotating and publishing its history and context on the Web and/or in a mobile ad-hoc network, supporting intelligent machine-to-machine interactions. Some proposed approaches required user intervention [17], while others aimed at autonomous self-description and decision-making [11]. <span class="comment ref do" data-id="1058479545" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-1058479545"><mark id="1058479545" property="schema:description">

                </sup></span>. Indeed, semantic-based approaches have wide adoption in pervasive MAS, and smart building automation is one of the most relevant areas [21, 42]. Ontologies have been used in all stages of the life cycle of HBA systems, including design and deployment, infrastructure description, data modeling and access, and device control [8, 18]. In [20] an ontology based building automation system delivered context aware information in a customized way to different kinds of users, e.g., upkeep and healthcare operators in a clinic. OWL device and user descriptions were matched through SPARQL queries and SWRL rules were used to combine logical constraints with context dependent temporal and numerical ones, achieving capabilities similar to classical Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems. Nevertheless, the solution was affected from poor maintainability, because installing new devices required not only manual configuration, but also changes to the reference ontology. The proposed architecture in [8] included a reasoning module exploiting rule-based inferences. Unfortunately, the system state should fully match the rule head in order to trigger its body. Full matches seldom occur in realistic scenarios, whose entities are featured by detailed, heterogeneous and often contradictory information, unless one uses very basic rules. In our approach, non-monotonic inference services allow supporting approximate matches, which can yield “good enough” results whenever full matches are not available. The proposed distributed Knowledge Base management and service discovery methods can be a foundation for developing further semantic SOA platform capabilities [28], including automated clustering [32], negotiation [42], composition [14] and substitution [38]. Finally, semantic alignment is often a problem in heterogeneous systems such as HBA and IoT. Several works, e.g., [16], propose mappings. This work leverages Linked Data principles to limit the issue, instead, by importing and reusing meaningful parts of other vocabularies in a larger social HBA modeled.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>IoT/HBA feature</p></td><td><p>Social environment </p></td><td><p>Semantic capability </p></td><td><p>Detailed description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Object / Device / Application   </p></td><td><p>Social agent </p></td><td><p>LDP-CoAP server &amp; client</p></td><td><p>Section 3.1.1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Functional profile  </p></td><td><p>Service</p></td><td><p>OWL service description </p></td><td><p>Section 3.2 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Object pairing</p></td><td><p>Social relationship (friend/follower)</p></td><td><p>LDP-CoAP interface</p></td><td><p>Section 3.1.3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">( Agarwal &amp; Gómez Fernandez, 2016)</span><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:4231617186}]">( Atzori, Iera, &amp; Morabito, 2012)</span></p></div>
