<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1.Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The Semantic Web (SW) has evolved, from focusing mostly on data publishing to also support increasingly complex queries such as interactive analytical queries. Simultaneously, the data available on the SW has evolved from being simple, most alphanumeric data, to also include complex data such as spatial data. Indeed, geospatial data is now common on the SW, but it remains difficult to analyze it. In a non-SW context, the main tools for interactive data analyses have been Data Warehouses (DWs) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools and queries. DWs store large volumes of data and are designed with a multidimensional (MD) modeling approach, which has shown itself to be intuitive for interactive data analytics. Concretely, DWs consist of MD data cubes. The cells of the cube represent the topic *Corresponding author. E-mail: nurefsan@cs.aau.dk. of analysis, and associate observation facts with numerical measures that can be aggregated. For example, a sales fact cube has measures such as QuantitySold and SalesPrice. Facts are linked to dimensions, which provide contextual information, e.g., sales date, product, and location. Dimensions are perspectives, which are used to analyze data, and are organized into hierarchies with levels, e.g., Store, City, and Region, that allow users to analyze and aggregate measures at different levels of detail. Levels have a set of attributes that describe the characteristics of the level members. In traditional DWs, the location dimension is widely used, but as a conventional dimension with alphanumeric data and thus only nominal reference to spatial concepts such as areas and places. This does not allow manipulating through spatial location data or deriving topological relations among the hierarchy levels of the location dimension. This yields a demand for truly spatial DWs for better analysis purposes. Including the geometric information of the location data, sig1570-0844/0-1900/$27.50 c 0 \u2013 IOS Press and the authors.

QB4SOLAP approach to SOLAP on the SW nificantly improves the analysis process (i.e., proximity analysis of the locations) with additional perspectives by revealing dynamic spatial hierarchy levels and new spatial members. Similarly, providing deep spatial analytics support for spatial SW data is very valuable. Spatial data requires specific treatment techniques, in particular encoding, special functions and different manipulation methods, which should be considered in the modeling process and querying. The current state of the art for the geospatial Semantic Web focuses on techniques for publishing, linking and querying spatial data, but supports only \u201Cplain\u201D spatial SW data (without support for spatial DW concepts such as spatial hierarchies, levels, and measures) and does not consider analytical queries over spatial RDF data (see Section 2 for details). </p><p><strong>Problem Definition</strong>. The proliferation of open geospatial data on the SW creates possibilities for advanced analysis of such data. Many examples exist of spatial Linked Open Data (LOD) published on the SW as RDF1,2,3,4 . These datasets have observations and measures that are well suited for analytical queries (e.g., water/air quality measurements, immigration rates, EU subsidies in agriculture, crop revenue, etc.). However, such datasets are typically not modeled with spatial dimension levels and hierarchies. Thus, they cannot be queried with interactive spatial analytical queries (a.k.a. SOLAP) on the SW. In the current state of the SW, if a (spatial) DW user would like to query the existing spatial RDF data from the SW with SOLAP operations, the user needs to download the RDF data, map it to a relational data model (i.e., with a snowflake schema), and then import it into a traditional spatial 1EuroStat: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat 2UK Environmental Data: http://environment.data. gov.uk 3Danish Agricultural Data: https://datahub.io/ dataset/govagribus-denmark 4Australian Climate Observations: https://datahub.io/ dataset/acorn-sat data warehouse in order to query with SOLAP, which is slow, labor-intensive, and stores the data in a nonopen format. </p><p><strong>Our Approach</strong>. On the contrary, annotating spatial RDF datasets with QB4SOLAP [16,17] allows users to define spatial multidimensional concepts on top of existing RDF data. Hence, the user can create and publish spatial data warehouses on the Semantic Web, which can be easily queried with SOLAP operations. Fig. 1 depicts the general workflow scenario, where the spatial RDF datasets from endpoints can be annotated with QB4SOLAP. This makes it possible for end users to use SOLAP queries. However, writing a SOLAP query in SPARQL can be very complicated for users inexperienced with SPARQL (e.g., traditional DW users). Due to the lack of MD semantics of spatial RDF data and the lack of translation techniques from high-level SOLAP expressions to SPARQL, there is a considerable entry barrier for advanced spatial data analysis on the SW for data warehouse users. </p><p><strong>Contributions</strong>. In order to address these issues, this paper makes a number of contributions. First, we propose QB4SOLAP, a generic and extensible vocabulary (metamodel) for spatial DWs on the SW. QB4SOLAP extends the most recent stable version of the QB4OLAP vocabulary with spatial concepts. We provide a full formalization of QB4SOLAP. The key concepts of spatial cube members, spatial hierarchies and levels, spatial measures, spatial aggregate functions (e.g., union, buffer, and convex\u2013hull) and topological relations among spatial dimension and hierarchy level members (e.g., within, intersects, and overlaps), are defined. Second, we define a number of analytical Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) operators over the model including giving formal semantics of the operators. The operators support advanced analytical queries over MD geospatial SW data. Third, we provide algorithms for generating spatially extended SPARQL queries for individual and nested SOLAP operators, which allows writing SOLAP queries without knowledge of RDF/SPARQL. Fourth, we validate the vocabulary, operators, and query generation algorithms by applying them to a realistic use case. </p><p><strong>Paper structure</strong>. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 defines preliminary spatial and OLAP concepts. Section 4 defines the QB4SOLAP vocabulary, while Section 5 defines the SOLAP operators. Section 6 provides the SPARQL query generation algorithms. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and points to future research. N.

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2.Relatedwork> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>DW and OLAP technologies have been successful for analyzing large volumes of data [1]. Combining DW/OLAP technologies with RDF data makes RDF data sources more easily available for interactive analysis. The following work concerns the integration of DW/OLAP with the SW. </p><p><strong>DW/OLAP and Semantic Web</strong>. Using OLAP to analyze SW data is considered in several approaches. K\u00E4mpgen et al. propose an extended model [23] on top of the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary (QB) [5] for interacting with statistical linked data via OLAP operations directly in SPARQL. However, it has the inherent limitations of QB and thus cannot support OLAP dimensions with hierarchies and levels, and built-in aggregate functions. Etcheverry et al. introduce QB4OLAP [11] as an extended vocabulary based on QB, with a full MD metamodel, supporting OLAP operations directly over RDF data with SPARQL queries. Nath et al. considers creating an Extract\u2013 Transform\u2013Load (ETL) framework for semantic data warehouses [8]. Varga et al. presents a comprehensive methodology for dimensional enrichment of statistical LOD by using QB4OLAP and provide a SW-based OLAP engine for traditional DW users [37]. However, these approaches and vocabularies support neither spatial DWs nor provide SOLAP operators for the SW. </p><p><strong>Spatial DW and OLAP</strong>. The constraint representation of spatial data has been the focus in many fields from databases to AI [32]. Extending OLAP with spatial features has also attracted the attention of the data warehousing community. B\u00E9dard et al. first introduced the term SOLAP [4] in 1997. SOLAP systems [9,33] since then, have significantly been improved. Respectively, various papers improve the spatial aggregation functions and techniques [6,14,28,38]. Several conceptual models are proposed for representing spatial data in data warehouses. Stefanovic et al. [19] considers constructing and materializing spatial cubes in their proposed model. The MultiDim conceptual model, introduced by Malinowski and Zim\u00E1nyi [27], copes with spatial features and is extended in [36], to include complex geometric features (continuous fields), with a set of operations and an MD calculus supporting spatial data types. G\u00F3mez et al. [15] propose an algebra and a general framework for OLAP cube analysis on discrete and continuous spatial data. Even though spatial data warehousing is thus widely studied, those studies are limited to traditional non-semantic spatial data warehouses and SOLAP techniques. The work above neither considered semantic web data nor spatial analytical querying in SPARQL. </p><p><strong>Geospatial Semantic Web</strong>. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has proposed GeoSPARQL [3] as a vocabulary to represent and query spatial data in RDF using an extension to SPARQL. Kyzirakos et al. present a comprehensive survey of data models and query languages for linked geospatial data in [25], and propose a semantic geospatial data store called Strabon in [24]. Strabon has an extensive query language called stSPARQL , which is however limited to the specific environment. LinkedGeoData is a significant contribution on interactive transformation of OpenStreetMap5 data to RDF data [35]. GeoKnow [26] is a more recent project with focus on linking geospatial data from heterogeneous sources. Andersen et al. considers publishing/converting open spatial data as Linked Open Data [2]. However, none of these works consider the MD aspects of geospatial data or allow querying with SOLAP on the SW, unlike QB4SOLAP. The QB4SOLAP vocabulary is validated with both the running example use case, the GeoNorthwind data cube, as well as a substantial real-world use case, the GeoFarmHerdState data cube [17]. GeoFarmHerdState is a spatial data cube about livestock holdings in Denmark, which integrates environmental and geographical open data from several sources, thus enabling a range of interesting SOLAP queries. In summary, none of the related work, which is surveyed in the fields of \u201CDW/OLAP and the SW&quot;, \u201CSpatial DW and OLAP&quot;, and \u201CGeospatial Semantic Web&quot; provides a substantial foundation for modeling and querying spatial data warehouses on the Semantic Web, unlike the QB4SOLAP vocabulary, SOLAP operators, and SPARQL generation algorithms presented in this paper. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
