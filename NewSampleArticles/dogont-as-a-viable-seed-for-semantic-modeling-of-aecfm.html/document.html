Several research groups and companies are working on techniques deriving from the Semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence to address the modeling of so many different aspects, be it at the application, sensing, or device level. Three initiatives, in particular, tackle this issue from different perspectives: the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, the Semantic Sensor Web (SSW) initiative, and the Semantic Big Data research activities. 1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 c 0 – IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 Bonino et al. / DogOnt as a viable seed for semantic modeling AEC/FM Linked Open Data (LOD) [3] acts at the application level and it provides machine understandable, shared and open semantics for representing a wide set of knowledge domains in the world. While monolithic approaches aim at modeling entire domains in a comprehensive manner, thus leading to single, rigid and practically not-scalable representation models, the LOD approach exploits the linking and mapping primitives defined in OWL and integrates more than 295 datasets1 with over 31 billions of triples representing real data, from personal e-mail contacts to world nations, from medical topics to plane parts. The Semantic Sensor Web (SSW) [27], instead, specifically focuses on sensing networks, thus aims to address the diversity of sensors and sensory data. To do so, it provides means for modeling sensor devices (and their capabilities), systems, and processes. The most important results of the SSW initiative are the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, defined by the W3C SSN XG group that was active from 2009 to 2011, and the related Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology [20]. Finally, the Semantic Big Data research field2 aims at empowering big data solutions (e.g., Complex Event Processing [26] or distributed data processing [8,22]) with semantic technologies such as ontologies as well as definitions and behavior (inference) rules, to tackle the data cardinality and the heterogeneity issue. This supports the transformation of “raw” data events into meaningful information conforming to a formal semantics, which, in turn, supports better understanding of situations (states) by machines (agents), better understanding of relationships between events and declarative processing of events, and reaction to situations (i.e., event patterns). Current modeling approaches and initiatives, however, are too general for the energy context (e.g., SSW [27]) or too domain-specific(e.g., [30]), since they aim at modeling each level and domain separately. In this way, a structured and comprehensive approach to a unified energy representation is not possible and, similarly, it is difficult to maintain the data consistency between the energetic information through levels and across sub-domains. 1Such a figure refers to 2011, with the number of datasets steadily increasing in the last years. 2A definition and some papers are available at https://www. ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/sbd/, last visited on July 4, 2017 This paper builds upon the motivations sustaining semantics as a viable solution to effectively tackling the energy domain in Smart Cities with a unified model. Starting from an analysis of ontologies at the state-of-the-art, the paper discusses an ontology representation, DogOnt3 , that was firstly published 8 years ago [4] and was initially designed, and developed, to tackle interoperability issues in home automation networks. In the past eight years, DogOnt evolved to tackle representation issues emerging from residential, building, and factory automation solutions. Lately, it included primitives for dealing with distributed networks of sensors deployed as part of smart buildings. Nowadays, DogOnt empowers several research projects needing uniform, semantic access to environment sensors and actuators. Those projects encompass several domains and field of interest. To exemplify, in the smart grid domain DogOnt has been used in the Leaf Island project (i.e., imported in the Leaf Ontology) [5], while in the JEERP project [7] it was used for building an Energy-Aware Enterprise Resource Planning. Furthermore, it has been incorporated in the EEOnt ontology [13] for providing an unified representation of energy efficiency in buildings, it has been used as “as a starting point for the specification of [some] concepts in ThinkHome” [25], adopted by the UniDA framework [29] for the integration and interoperation of devices in Human Interaction Environments, and it was among the most important sources used in the creation of the SAREF ETSI standard [11,15]. Eventually, it successfully supports abstraction of several standards including both Internet of Things (e.g., ZigBee4 ) and non-IoT (e.g., Modbus) technologies. We claim and demonstrate that DogOnt can be used as a foundation towards a shared and unified model for the energy modeling in Smart Cities. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an up-to-date overview of the current modeling panorama for energy consumptions and assessment in Smart City settings. Section 3 introduces the DogOnt model in its current form, by discussing the foundations and showing practical modeling examples, while Section 4 motivates and illustrates why DogOnt can be used as a unified model for this context, thus serving as an evaluation of the proposed approach. 3The DogOnt ontology is available at http://elite. polito.it/ontologies/dogont.owl 4 e.g., the ZigBee Home Automation (HA) extension is available at http://elite.polito.it/ontologies/zigbee.owl.

                </sup></span> and representation demands for models able to deal with an increasing variety of ground truth data, generated through heterogeneous monitoring networks and devices. The emergence of IoT approaches to Smart Cities is stressing the importance of a uniform and machine understandable representation of the energy qualities of devices, rooms, buildings and, by extension, of districts and entire cities. This need is currently acknowledged by several research efforts, both industrial and academic, which aim at building domain ontologies to model energy consumption and performance. In the energy domain, ontologies are employed to define shared and common inter-language for performance evaluation, energy rating, device consumption profiling, etc. Approaches present in the literature, typically, address the energy domain by splitting the analysis along different forms of energy, i.e., electrical and thermal. On the one hand, this division permits to tackle the specificity of the single energy form and the related engineering domains. On the other hand, it prevents a structured and comprehensive approach to energy representation, at higher levels of detail, like at the district level. </p></div>

                        <p>Electric energy consumption is one of the most important aspects modeled in the smart environments (e.g., home and building) domain. Such an importance is related to the amount of “saving” that can be achieved by considering energy management as fundamental part of home and building automation. Approaches for modeling energy consumption in smart environments mainly address the problem under two complimentary point of views. The first aims at modeling instantaneous consumption, i.e., consumption levels associated to specific, observable states of devices and appliances. The last, instead, considers the overall consumption “profile” of a given electric device, i.e., the sequence of consumption levels associated to a complete “working” cycle. As an example, consider a washing machine. The first approach finely models the machine consumption when spinning, heating water, drying clothes, etc. while inferring the current consumption according to the machine state. The second, instead, considers complete washing cycles (e.g., delicate washing) and models the energy consumption trend with respect to time, often in discrete steps. PowerOnt [6]5 follows the first approach and provides a lightweight ontology that models consumption associated to specific states of devices. A rather coarse, yet modular, approach is used for defining three levels of consumption for each state, with increasing level of details. States are associated with a typical consumption (in Watt) which is derived from catalogs of device categories, e.g., “A class” fridges. Such a typical consumption can be better specified if the nominal consumption rate is available for the specific state. Finally, the model provides means to model the actual consumption of the device, in a given state, extracted through direct metering. No notion of time is included in the model, and no direct/explicit support to thermal energy is provided. However, the model is general enough to represent both thermal and electric energy, with a little extension. The challenge of representing electric device consumption has been tackled in several initiatives driven by home automation standardization bodies. Among these, the Energy@Home consortium6 , which was involved in the definition of the ZigBee Smart Energy [32] and Home Automation [31] specifications, tackled energy consumption modeling in terms of energy profiles, i.e., of sequences of consumption levels, which evolve in time depending on the device type/- operating cycle. Unfortunately, such profiles have not been formalized in terms of ontologies and they have only been modeled in terms of data-types associated to specific ZigBee clusters.</p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">( Berrueta &amp; Phipps, 2008)</span><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:3871687481}]">(Bonino &amp; Procaccianti, 2014)</span></p></section></div><h1 class="article-bibliography-header"></h1><section id="references">
