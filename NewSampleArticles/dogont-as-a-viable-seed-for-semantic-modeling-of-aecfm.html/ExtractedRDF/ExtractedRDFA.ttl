E-mail: bonino@ismb.it In such a context, intelligent, and in particular, semantic-based approaches can be seen as viable solutions to extract sense from the vast sea of information made available by the large number of sensors spread all over the city, at different levels, and involving the various stakeholders. Several research groups and companies are working on techniques deriving from the Semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence to address the modeling of so many different aspects, be it at the application, sensing, or device level. Three initiatives, in particular, tackle this issue from different perspectives: the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, the Semantic Sensor Web (SSW) initiative, and the Semantic Big Data research activities. 1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 c 0 \u2013 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 Bonino et al. / DogOnt as a viable seed for semantic modeling AEC/FM Linked Open Data (LOD) [3] acts at the application level and it provides machine understandable, shared and open semantics for representing a wide set of knowledge domains in the world. While monolithic approaches aim at modeling entire domains in a comprehensive manner, thus leading to single, rigid and practically not-scalable representation models, the LOD approach exploits the linking and mapping primitives defined in OWL and integrates more than 295 datasets1 with over 31 billions of triples representing real data, from personal e-mail contacts to world nations, from medical topics to plane parts. The Semantic Sensor Web (SSW) [27], instead, specifically focuses on sensing networks, thus aims to address the diversity of sensors and sensory data. To do so, it provides means for modeling sensor devices (and their capabilities), systems, and processes. The most important results of the SSW initiative are the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, defined by the W3C SSN XG group that was active from 2009 to 2011, and the related Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology [20]. Finally, the Semantic Big Data research field2 aims at empowering big data solutions (e.g., Complex Event Processing [26] or distributed data processing [8,22]) with semantic technologies such as ontologies as well as definitions and behavior (inference) rules, to tackle the data cardinality and the heterogeneity issue. This supports the transformation of \u201Craw\u201D data events into meaningful information conforming to a formal semantics, which, in turn, supports better understanding of situations (states) by machines (agents), better understanding of relationships between events and declarative processing of events, and reaction to situations (i.e., event patterns). Current modeling approaches and initiatives, however, are too general for the energy context (e.g., SSW [27]) or too domain-specific(e.g., [30]), since they aim at modeling each level and domain separately. In this way, a structured and comprehensive approach to a unified energy representation is not possible and, similarly, it is difficult to maintain the data consistency between the energetic information through levels and across sub-domains. 1Such a figure refers to 2011, with the number of datasets steadily increasing in the last years. 2A definition and some papers are available at https://www. ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/sbd/, last visited on July 4, 2017 This paper builds upon the motivations sustaining semantics as a viable solution to effectively tackling the energy domain in Smart Cities with a unified model. Starting from an analysis of ontologies at the state-of-the-art, the paper discusses an ontology representation, DogOnt3 , that was firstly published 8 years ago [4] and was initially designed, and developed, to tackle interoperability issues in home automation networks. In the past eight years, DogOnt evolved to tackle representation issues emerging from residential, building, and factory automation solutions. Lately, it included primitives for dealing with distributed networks of sensors deployed as part of smart buildings. Nowadays, DogOnt empowers several research projects needing uniform, semantic access to environment sensors and actuators. Those projects encompass several domains and field of interest. To exemplify, in the smart grid domain DogOnt has been used in the Leaf Island project (i.e., imported in the Leaf Ontology) [5], while in the JEERP project [7] it was used for building an Energy-Aware Enterprise Resource Planning. Furthermore, it has been incorporated in the EEOnt ontology [13] for providing an unified representation of energy efficiency in buildings, it has been used as \u201Cas a starting point for the specification of [some] concepts in ThinkHome\u201D [25], adopted by the UniDA framework [29] for the integration and interoperation of devices in Human Interaction Environments, and it was among the most important sources used in the creation of the SAREF ETSI standard [11,15]. Eventually, it successfully supports abstraction of several standards including both Internet of Things (e.g., ZigBee4 ) and non-IoT (e.g., Modbus) technologies. We claim and demonstrate that DogOnt can be used as a foundation towards a shared and unified model for the energy modeling in Smart Cities. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an up-to-date overview of the current modeling panorama for energy consumptions and assessment in Smart City settings. Section 3 introduces the DogOnt model in its current form, by discussing the foundations and showing practical modeling examples, while Section 4 motivates and illustrates why DogOnt can be used as a unified model for this context, thus serving as an evaluation of the proposed approach. 3The DogOnt ontology is available at http://elite. polito.it/ontologies/dogont.owl 4 e.g., the ZigBee Home Automation (HA) extension is available at http://elite.polito.it/ontologies/zigbee.owl. Bonino et al. / DogOnt as a viable seed for semantic modeling AEC/FM 3 Finally, Section 5 provides final remarks and discusses the foreseen evolutions in the next 5 years. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

The emergence of IoT approaches to Smart Cities is stressing the importance of a uniform and machine understandable representation of the energy qualities of devices, rooms, buildings and, by extension, of districts and entire cities. This need is currently acknowledged by several research efforts, both industrial and academic, which aim at building domain ontologies to model energy consumption and performance. In the energy domain, ontologies are employed to define shared and common inter-language for performance evaluation, energy rating, device consumption profiling, etc. Approaches present in the literature, typically, address the energy domain by splitting the analysis along different forms of energy, i.e., electrical and thermal. On the one hand, this division permits to tackle the specificity of the single energy form and the related engineering domains. On the other hand, it prevents a structured and comprehensive approach to energy representation, at higher levels of detail, like at the district level. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
