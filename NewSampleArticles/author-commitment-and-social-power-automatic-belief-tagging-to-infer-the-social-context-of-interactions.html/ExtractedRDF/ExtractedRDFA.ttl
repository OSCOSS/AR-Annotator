In this paper, we employ advancements in extrapropositional semantics extraction within NLP to study how author commitment reflects the social context of an interactions. Specifi- cally, we investigate whether the level of commitment expressed by individuals in an organizational interaction reflects the hierarchical power structures they are part of. We find that subordinates use significantly more instances of non-commitment than superiors. More importantly, we also find that subordinates attribute propositions to other agents more often than superiors do \u2014 an aspect that has not been studied before. Finally, we show that enriching lexical features with commitment labels captures important distinctions in social meanings.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2RelatedWork> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The notion of belief that we use in this paper (Diab et al., 2009; Prabhakaran et al., 2015) is closely related to the notion of factuality that is captured in FactBank (Saur\u00B4\u0131 and Pustejovsky, 2009). They capture three levels of factuality, certain (CT), probable (PB), and possible (PS), as well as the underspecified factuality (Uu). They also record the corresponding polarity values, and the source of the factuality assertions to distinguish between factuality assertions by the author and those by the agents/sources introduced by the author. While FactBank offers a finer granularity, they are annotated on newswire text. Hence, we use the corpus of belief annotations (Prabhakaran et al., 2015) that is obtained on online discussion forums, which is closer to our genre. Automatic hedge/uncertainty detection is a very closely related task to belief detection. The belief tagging framework we use aims to capture the cognitive states of authors, whereas hedges are linguistic expressions that convey one of those cognitive states \u2014 non-committed beliefs. Automatic hedge/uncertainty detection has generated active research in recent years within the NLP community. Early work in this area focused on detecting speculative language in scientific text (Mercer et al., 2004; Di Marco et al., 2006; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008). The open evaluation as part of the CoNLL shared task in 2010 to detect uncertainty and hedging in biomedical and Wikipedia text (Farkas et al., 2010) triggered further research on this problem in the general domain (Agarwal and Yu, 2010; Morante et al., 2010; Velldal et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2012). Most of this work was aimed at formal scientific text in English. More recent work has tried to extend this work to other genres (Wei et al., 2013; Sanchez and Vogel, 2015) and languages (Velupillai, 2012; Vincze, 2014), as well as building general purpose hedge lexicons (Prokofieva and Hirschberg, 2014). In our work, we use the lexicons from (Prokofieva and Hirschberg, 2014) to capture hedges in text. Sociolinguists have long studied the association between level of commitment and social contexts (Lakoff, 1973; O\u2019Barr and Atkins, 1980; Hyland, 1998). A majority of this work studies gender differences in the use of hedges, triggered by the influential work by Robin Lakoff (Lakoff, 1973). She argued that women use linguistic strategies such as hedging and hesitations in order to adopt an unassertive communication style, which she terms \u201Cwomen\u2019s language\u201D. While many studies have found evidence to support Lakoff\u2019s theory (e.g., (Crosby and Nyquist, 1977; Preisler, 1986; Carli, 1990)), there have also been contradictory findings (e.g., (O\u2019Barr and Atkins, 1980)) that link the difference in the use of hedges to other social factors (e.g., power). O\u2019Barr and Atkins (1980) argue that the use of hedges is linked more to the social positions rather than gender, suggesting to rename \u201Cwomen\u2019s language\u201D to \u201Cpowerless language\u201D. In later work, O\u2019Barr (1982) formalized the notion of powerless language, which formed the basis of many sociolinguistics studies on social power and communication. O\u2019Barr (1982) analyzed courtroom interactions and identified hedges and hesitations as some of the linguistic markers of \u201Cpowerless\u201D speech. However, there has not been any computational work which has looked into how power relations relate to the level of commitment expressed in text. In this paper, we use com- putational power analysis to perform a large scale data-oriented study on how author commitment in text reveals the underlying power relations. There is a large body of literature in the social sciences that studies power as a social construct (e.g., (French and Raven, 1959; Dahl, 1957; Emerson, 1962; Pfeffer, 1981; Wartenberg, 1990)) and how it relates to the ways people use language in social situations (e.g., (Bales et al., 1951; Bales, 1970; O\u2019Barr, 1982; Van Dijk, 1989; Bourdieu and Thompson, 1991; Ng and Bradac, 1993; Fairclough, 2001; Locher, 2004)). Recent years have seen growing interest in computationally analyzing and detecting power and influence from interactions. Early work in computational power analysis used social network analysis based approaches (Diesner and Carley, 2005; Shetty and Adibi, 2005; Creamer et al., 2009) or email traffic patterns (Namata et al., 2007). Using NLP to deduce social relations from online communication is a relatively new area of active research. Bramsen et al. (2011) and Gilbert (2012) first applied NLP based techniques to predict power relations in Enron emails, approaching this task as a text classification problem using bag of words or ngram features. More recently, our work has used dialog structure features derived from deeper dialog act analysis for the task of power prediction in Enron emails (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014; Prabhakaran et al., 2012; Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2013). In this paper, We use the framework of (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014), but we analyze a novel aspect of interaction that has not been studied before \u2014 what level of commitment do the authors express in language. There has also been work on analyzing power in other genres of interactions. Strzalkowski et al. (2010) and Taylor et al. (2012) concentrate on lower-level constructs called Language Uses such as agenda control to predict power in Wikipedia talk pages. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) study how social power and linguistic coordination are correlated in Wikipedia interactions as well as Supreme Court hearings. Bracewell et al. (2012) and Swayamdipta and Rambow (2012) try to identify pursuit of power in discussion forums. Biran et al. (2012) and Rosenthal (2014) study the problem of predicting influence in Wikipedia talk pages, blogs, and other online forums. Prabhakaran et al. (2013) study manifestations of power of confidence in presidential debates. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p> Social power is a difficult concept to define, but is often manifested in how we interact with one another. Understanding these manifestations is important not only to answer fundamental questions in social sciences about power and social interactions, but also to build computational models that can automatically infer social power structures from interactions. The availability and access to large digital repositories of naturally occurring social interactions and the advancements in natural language processing techniques in recent years have enabled researchers to perform large scale studies on linguistic correlates of power, such as words and phrases (Bramsen et al., 2011; Gilbert, 2012), linguistic coordination (DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), agenda control (Taylor et al., 2012), and dialog structure (Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2014). Another area of research that has recently garnered interest within the NLP community is the modeling of author commitment in text. Initial studies in this area were done in processing hedges, uncertainty and lack of commitment, specifically focused on scientific text (Mercer et al., 2004; Di Marco et al., 2006; Farkas et al., 2010). More recently, researchers have also looked into capturing author commitment in nonscientific text, e.g., levels of factuality in newswire (Saur\u00B4\u0131 and Pustejovsky, 2009), types of commitment of beliefs in a variety of genres including conversational text (Diab et al., 2009; Prabhakaran et al., 2015). These approaches are motivated from an information extraction perspective, for instance in aiding tasks such as knowledge base population.1 However, it has not been studied whether such sophisticated author commitment analysis can go beyond what is expressed in language and reveal the underlying social contexts in which language is exchanged. In this paper, we bring together these two lines of research; we study how power relations correlate with the levels of commitment authors express in interactions. We use the power analysis framework built by Prabhakaran and Rambow (2014) to perform this study, and measure author commitment using the committed belief tagging framework introduced by (Diab et al., 2009) that distinguishes different types of beliefs expressed in text. Our contributions are two-fold \u2014 statistical analysis of author commitment in relation with power, and enrichment of lexical features with commitment labels to aid in computational prediction of power relations. In the first part, we find that au- 1The BeSt track of the 2017 TAC-KBP evaluation aimed at detecting the \u201Cbelief and sentiment of an entity toward another entity, relation, or event\u201D (http://www.cs. columbia.edu/\u02DCrambow/best-eval-2017/). thor commitment is significantly correlated with the social power relations between their participants \u2014 subordinates use more instances of noncommitment, a finding that is in line with sociolinguistics studies in this area. We also find that subordinates use significantly more reported beliefs (i.e., attributing beliefs to other agents) than superiors. This is a new finding; to our knowledge, there has not been any sociolinguistics studies investigating this aspect of interaction in relation with power. In the second part, we present novel ways of incorporating the author commitment information into lexical features that can capture important distinctions in word meanings conveyed through the belief contexts in which they occur; distinctions that are lost in a model that conflates all occurrences of a word into one unit. We first describe the related work in computational power analysis and computational modeling of cognitive states in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the power analysis framework we use. Section 4 formally defines the research questions we are investigating, and describes how we obtain the belief information. In Section 5, we present the statistical analysis of author commitment and power. Section 6 presents the utility of enriching lexical features with belief labels in the context of automatic power prediction. Section 7 concludes the paper and summarizes the results. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
