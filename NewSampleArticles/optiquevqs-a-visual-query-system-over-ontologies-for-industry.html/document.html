			                <p>Adoption of semantic technologies has been a recent development in many large companies such as IBM [34], the steel manufacturer Arcelor Mittal [5], the oil and gas company Statoil [51], and Siemens [1, 55,74]. An important application of these technologies 1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 © 0 – IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 A. Soylu et al. / OptiqueVQS: a Visual Query System over Ontologies for Industry has been the formalisation of information models1 using OWL 2 ontologies and the use of RDF for storing application data. OWL 2 provides a rich and flexible modelling language, which is well-suited for describing industrial information models [2,35,54]. It comes with unambiguous and standardised semantics, as well as a wide range of tools to develop, validate, integrate, and reason with such models. In turn, RDF data can not only be seamlessly accessed and exchanged, but also stored directly in highly scalable RDF triple stores and effectively queried in conjunction with the available ontologies. Moreover, legacy and other data that must remain in its original format and cannot be transformed into RDF can be virtualised as RDF using ontologies following the ontology-based data access (OBDA) approach [58,70,94]. In all these applications, it is important to provide domain experts—who have extensive domain knowledge but not necessarily skills and knowledge in semantic technologies and formal query languages such as SPARQL—with query formulation tools for expressing their information needs over ontologies. The problem of query formulation for end users has been acknowledged by many [7,21,36,91] and numerous systems have been developed so far. These systems can be categorised as follows: </p><ol><li><p><em>Textual query editors</em> (e.g., the Virtuoso SPARQL Query Editor2 ) employ the full expressivity of SPARQL, but demand technical skills and knowledge (i.e., on syntax and schema). Contextaware editors, such as SparQLed [19], offer autocompletion and recommendations based on the schema and dataset.</p></li><li><p><em>Keyword search</em> (e.g., [14]) interprets a query as a bag of words. These systems are simple to use, but are inherently limited in expressiveness. There are approaches, such as KESOSD [62] and SWSE [42], that aim at increasing the accuracy and completeness of keyword search. </p></li><li><p><em>Natural language interfaces</em> (e.g., [47,61]) interpret natural language phrases as queries, taking linguistic considerations into account, but suffer from ambiguities and linguistic variability. There 1An information model is a representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse [59], such as functionality of and information flow between different assets in a power plant [54,72]. 2See e.g. http://dbpedia.org/sparql for an instance of the Virtuoso editor. are approaches to overcome this problem, such as user dialogues for feedback and clarification [26]. </p></li><li><p><em>Visual query languages</em> (VQL), such as RDF-GL [43] and QueryVOWL [38], are based on a welldefined formal semantics with a visual notation and syntax. They are comparable to formal textual languages as they demand technical skills and knowledge to interpret the visual formalism. </p></li><li><p><em>Visual query systems</em> (VQS) [21], such as Rhizomer [15] and Konduit VQB [4], are based on a system of interactions rather than a visual formalism, and therefore can have a design demanding no or limited technical background. They often compromise expressivity to reach a fine balance between expressiveness and usability. </p></li></ol><p>To the best of our knowledge, no system from any of these categories has been developed to meet industrial requirements or evaluated with industrial users. In this work we present a VQS, namely OptiqueVQS [86,89], which is designed upon (i) requirements from Statoil and Siemens consolidated during the joint OBDA project Optique3 [31,32], and (ii) best HCI practices for interdisciplinary engineering environments. OptiqueVQS implements a number of unique techniques that distinguish it from comparable query formulation systems. In particular: </p><ul><li><p>it exploits ontology projection techniques to enable graph-based navigation over an ontology during query construction; </p></li><li><p>while OptiqueVQS is primarily ontology driven, it exploits sampled data to enhance selection of data values for some data attributes; </p></li><li><p>it is built on well-grounded requirements, design rationale, and quality attributes; and </p></li><li><p>it is evaluated with different types of end users in different contexts. </p></li></ul><p>We evaluated OptiqueVQS with different user groups and contex A. Soylu et al. / OptiqueVQS: a Visual Query System over Ontologies for Industry 3 Finally, we qualitatively compared OptiqueVQS against prominent existing visual systems for ontologydriven query formulation and exploration of semantic data that are the most relevant to our system. For the comparison, we considered gFacet [41], OZONE [95], SparqlFilterFlow [37], Konduit VQB [4], Rhizomer [15], PepeSearch [102], Super Stream Collider framework [73], and TELIOS Spatial [28]. The comparison revealed that OptiqueVQS possesses an important set of quality attributes relevant in an industrial context, while others meet only a few of them. OptiqueVQS is available online and can be downloaded together with an example OBDA scenario including a data set, an ontology, mappings etc. from the project’s website (see Section 6 for details). The rest of this article is organised as follows: in Section 2, we highlight the main contributions of this article with links to our related work. In Section 3, we present preliminary notations and concepts used throughout the article. In Section 4, we present the Statoil and Siemens use cases. In Section 5, we discuss a set of requirements and quality attributes, while in Section 6, we present OptiqueVQS itself. In Sections 7 and 8, we evaluate OptiqueVQS, first against the requirements and then using a set of usability studies. In Section 9, we discuss related work and similar tools, while in Section 10 we discuss both our main findings and the limitations of OptiqueVQS. Finally, we conclude the article and discuss the future work in Section 11. </p></div>

			                <p>OptiqueVQS can be used in two different scenarios – see Figure 1: directly over a triple store through an endpoint (i.e., scenario A), or over an OBDA framework that virtualises relational data into RDF (i.e., scenario B). In both scenarios, the setup consists of two parts. Part A deals with visual query formulation and Part B with query answering. The contributions of this article fall into visual query formulation (i.e., part A), while OBDA is the application scenario (i.e., scenario B) [32]. Our work builds on several iterative and selfstanding focused research activities complementing each other. This article extends our previous work on OptiqueVQS in several important directions. In particular, we present: </p><p>(a) a detailed account of the Statoil and Siemens use cases, characterising existing data sources, data access infrastructure, end-users, and data access routines such as the frequency of interaction, variance of query tasks, and structural complexity of query tasks; </p><p>(b) requirements collected systematically, including a comprehensive analysis and classification of representative queries collected from use cases and established best practices culled from experience with visual query systems for relational databases; </p><p>(c) a qualitative comparison with eight other query formulation systems based on quality attributes collected from literature and a set of corresponding features realising the suggested quality attributes; </p><p>(d) a detailed analysis of design choices behind OptiqueVQS supporting the design rationale behind each representation and interaction paradigm and extensions for spatial and temporal query formulation support; </p><p>(e) three extensive user studies with domain experts at Siemens and Statoil and a discussion of limitations and key findings from these studies; and </p><p>(f) an improved and extended OptiqueVQS backend presented in detail, including its expressive power and the role of and motivation behind each individual component. </p><p>Regarding the links to our previous and related work, extensions (a), (b), (c), and (d) follow the methodology and a qualitative analysis of visual query formulation approaches that we extracted through a survey [80,91]. We discussed initial ideas on design and implementation of OptiqueVQS with domain experts at Statoil and Siemens (d) by rapidly developing a prototype [85,86]. An early user study with casual users on a generic domain [89] provided us with early insights before experimenting with the domain experts (e); — domain experts often have constrained availability, while casual users are more accessible and have desired characteristics for our purposes (i.e., lack of technical knowledge and skills). Additionally, a comparative user study [103] allowed us to compare the suitability of graph and form-based paradigms for different user groups (d) and revealed supporting evidence for our core design choice. The OptiqueVQS backend [88,89] has been consolidated continuously as a result of the requirements collected through user experi- 4 A.

For example, we developed a technique for ranking and ordering ontology elements (i.e., adaptive query formulation) based on query logs (f), which falls outside the scope of this article but is presented elsewhere [87]. The Optique solution, as an end-to-end OBDA framework including OptiqueVQS, has been deployed in Statoil [51,53,56] and Siemens [50,52,57]. The specifics of OBDA setup, such as mappings, query transformation, deployment, and query answering (i.e., the part B of scenario B) are also beyond the scope of this article. </p><figure data-equation="" data-image="26" data-figure-category="figure" data-caption="" id="F7920871" data-image-src="/media/images/98630cea-ef8d-4945-9dc4-fe54421f99b4.jpg"><div><img src="98630cea-ef8d-4945-9dc4-fe54421f99b4.jpg"/></div><figcaption><span class="figure-cat-figure" data-figure-category="figure">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure></div>

			                <p>In the following, we give a brief tour of some notions from description logics (DL), RDF, OWL, SPARQL queries and their semantics. The goal of this section is to semi-formally introduce some relevant semantic web notions that we follow, in order to prepare the reader for the examples and explanations appearing in the article. Since in this article we study how to support the construction of queries over ontologies in industrial settings and focus mostly on user driven requirements rather than complexity and other formal accounts, we make the formal descriptions below light weight and refer the reader to relevant material for more details. We use standard notions from first-order logic. We assume pairwise disjoint countably infinite sets of constants, unary predicates (also called classes or atomic classes) and binary predicates (also called properties). Constants, in turn, are divided into disjoint sets of objects (also called individuals) and literal values. A fact is a ground atom and a knowledge base is finite set of facts. An ontology is a finite set of first-order sentences. The web ontology language OWL 2 [24] is a recursive set of ontologies, closed under renaming of constants and the subset relation. Each OWL 2 ontology can be represented using a specialised DL syntax [8,45] where variables are omitted and which provides operators for constructing complex concepts and properties from simpler ones, as well as a set of axioms. The semantics of an OWL 2 ontology is defined in a standard way using first-order interpretations [64]. Note that, for convenience and readability, in the examples we use the Manchester OWL syntax [44], which is a user-friendly compact syntax for OWL 2 ontologies For example, consider the following statement about the application domain: “every wellbore has (at least) one core”. This statement can be written as an OWL 2 axiom of the form (see Section 6.2.1 for further details): Wellbore SubClassOf: hasCore some Core SPARQL [40] is the standard query language to access RDF data. SPARQL queries are defined in terms of basic graph patterns (BGPs) Q(~x), i.e., sets of triples of the form hn1, e, n2i, where the ni denote nodes in a graph and e denotes an edge, and all three can either be concrete nodes (i.e., constants or unary predicates) and edges (i.e., binary predicates), or variables; some of these variables form the vector ~x of Q’s A. Soylu et al. / OptiqueVQS: a Visual Query System over Ontologies for Industry 5 output variables. In this work, we focus on the construction of SPARQL queries where basic graph patterns do not have variables on the second position, nor on the third position when e is rdf: type. This means that, we do not allow predicates as variables, and thus our queries can naturally be represented as conjunctions of unary and binary atoms. SPARQL 1.1 also supports filtering, union of BGPs, aggregate functions, and other operators. We allow only a limited number of these due to usability concerns. The semantics of query answering is defined in the standard way in terms of homomorphism [3]: a vector of constants ~t is the answer for a conjunctive query Q(~x) over a dataset D, if there is a homomorphism from the query to D such that the vector of output variables is matched to ~t. These semantics can be naturally extended from datasets to first-order logic (FOL) interpretations of datasets and ontologies [8]. </p></div>

			                <p>In the context of the Optique project, the development and evaluation of OptiqueVQS was guided by use cases from Statoil and Siemens, including sample queries and data sets. In both cases, domain experts typically access relevant data through predefined queries. IT experts, who have extensive technical knowledge but often lack domain knowledge, extract relevant data through an extract-load-transform (ETL) process [29] when an information need is not met through available queries. However, this approach is quite inefficient and highly iterative due to miscommunication between IT experts and domain experts, high workload of IT experts, complexity of query formulation, and long query execution times. Statoil and Siemens have their data stored in relational databases rather than triple stores, as majority of the world’s enterprises do. In the Optique project, the use case data sets have been represented as knowledge bases using an OBDA technology to enable inplace querying of legacy relational data sources [32]. OBDA technologies are important in the context of visual query formulation as well, as they extend the reach of ontology-based visual query formulation from triple stores to relational databases; hence, raising it as a viable and realistic solution for all. The OBDA approach we employed is built on two mechanisms [18,22,94]: </p><p>(a) mappings declaratively relate ontological terms with the underlying data and are used to virtualise the relational data in databases into graph data expressed over a language defined in an ontology; </p><p>(b) and query rewriting is used to expand and translate the posed queries (e.g., SPARQL) into the language of the underlying relational database system (e.g., SQL) hosting the data for execution. </p><p>The specifics of the OBDA framework are out of scope of this work; therefore, we refer interested readers to the Optique project [31,32,50,51]. In the following subsections, we describe the characteristics of each use case. We believe that they are representative for many of the data access challenges faced by today’s data-intensive industries. Descriptions were provided by the organisations themselves and confirmed through interviews and on-site visits. We highlight and mark some parts of the descriptions as evidences (i.e.,En ) supporting the requirements presented in Section 5. Due to corporate confidentiality policies, some numbers in the descriptions have been approximated.</p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">(Abele, Legat, Grimm, &amp; Muller, 2013)</span><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:921794627}]">(Abele, Grimm, Zillner, &amp; Kleinsteuber, 2014)</span></p></div>
