			                <p>Data mining is defined as â€˜â€˜a non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in dataâ€™â€™[1], or â€˜â€˜the analysis of (often large) observational datasets to find unsuspected relationships and to summarize the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data ownerâ€™â€™[2]. <span class="comment ref do" data-id="250645784" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-250645784"><mark id="250645784" property="schema:description">

                </sup></span>. Thus, knowledge plays a crucial role here. Knowledge can be (a) in the primary data itself, from where it is discovered using appropriate algorithms and tools, (b) in external data, which has to be included with the problem first (such as background statistics or master file data not yet linked to the primary data), or (c) in the data analystâ€™s mind only.</p><p>The latter two cases are interesting opportunities to enhance the value of the knowledge discovery processes. Consider the following case: a dataset consists of countries in Europe and some economic and social indicators. There are, for sure, some interesting patterns that can be discovered in the data. However, an analyst dealing with such data on a regular basis will know that some of the countries are part of the European Union, while others are not. Thus, she may add an additional variable EU_Member to the dataset, which may lead to new insights (e.g., certain patterns holding for EU member states only).</p><p>In that example, knowledge has been added to the data from the analystâ€™s mind, but it might equally well have been contained in some exterior source of knowledge, such as Linked Open Data.</p><p>Linked Open Data (LOD) is an open, interlinked collection of datasets in machine-interpretable form, covering multiple domains from life sciences to government data[3,4]. Thus, it should be possible to make use of that vault of knowledge in a given data mining, at various steps of the knowledge discovery process.</p><p>Many approaches have been proposed in the recent past for using LOD in data mining processes, for various purposes, such as the creation of additional variables, as in the example above. With this paper, we provide a structured survey of such approaches.</p><p>Following the well-known data mining process model proposed by Fayyad etal.[1], we discuss how semantic data is exploited at the different stages of the data mining model. Furthermore, we analyze how different characteristics of Linked Open Data, such as the presence of interlinks between datasets and the usage of ontologies as schemas for the data, are exploited by the different approaches.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets the scope of this survey, and puts it in the context of other surveys in similar areas. Section 3 describes the knowledge discovery process according to Fayyad et al. In Section 4, we introduce a general model for data mining using Linked Open Data, followed by a description of approaches using Semantic Web data in the different stages of the knowledge discovery process in Sections 5 through 9.</p><p>In Section 10, we give an example use-case of LOD-enabled KDD process in the domain of recommender systems. We conclude with a summary of our findings, and identify a number of promising directions for future research.</p></div>

			                <p>In the last decade, a vast amount of approaches have been proposed which combine methods from data mining and knowledge discovery with Semantic Web data. The goal of those approaches is to support different data mining tasks, or to improve the Semantic Web itself. All those approaches can be divided into three broader categories:</p><ul><li><p>Using Semantic Web based approaches, Semantic Web Technologies, and Linked Open Data to support the process of knowledge discovery.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Using data mining techniques to mine the Semantic Web, also called Semantic Web Mining</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>.Using machine learning techniques to create and improve Semantic Web data.</p></li></ul><p>Stumme et al. [5] have provided an initial survey of all three categories, later focusing more on the second category. Dating back to 2006, this survey does not reflect recent research works and trends, such as the advent and growth of Linked Open Data. More recent surveys on the second category, i.e., Semantic Web Mining, have been published by Sridevi etal.[6], Quboa etal.[7], Sivakumaretal.[8], and Dou etal.[9].</p><p>Tresp et al. [10] give an overview of the challenges and opportunities for the third category, i.e., machine learning on the Semantic Web, and using machine learning approaches to support the Semantic Web. The work has been extended in[11].</p><p>In contrast to those surveys, the first categoryâ€“ i.e., the usage of Semantic Web and Linked Open Data to support and improve data mining and knowledge discovery has not been subject of a recent survey.Thus, in this survey, we focus on that area.</p><p>The aim of this survey is to give a survey on the field as broad as possible, i.e., capturing as many different research directions as possible. As a consequence, a direct comparison of approaches is not always possible, since they may have been developed with slightly different goals, tailored towards particular use cases and/or datasets, etc. Nevertheless, we try to formulate at least coarse grained comparisons and recommendations, wherever possible.</p><p>3. The knowledge discovery process In their seminal paper from 1996, Fayyad et al. introduced a process model for knowledge discovery processes. The model comprises five steps, which lead from raw data to actionable knowledge and insights which are of immediate value to the user.</p><p>The whole process is shown in Fig.1. It comprises five steps:</p><p>1. <em>Selection </em>The first step is developing an understanding of the application domain, capturing relevant prior knowledge, and identifying the data mining goal from the end userâ€™s perspective. Based on that understanding, the target data used in the knowledge discovery process can be chosen, i.e., selecting proper data samples and a relevant subset of variables.</p><p>2. <em>Preprocessing </em>In this step, the selected data is processed in a way that allows for a subsequent analysis. Typical actions taken in this step include the handling of missing values, the identification (and potentially correction) of noise and errors in the data, the elimination of duplicates, as well as the matching, fusion, and conflict resolution for data taken from different sources.</p><p>3. <em>Transformation</em> The third step produces a projection of the data to a form that data mining algorithms can work onâ€”in most cases, this means turning the data into a propositional form, where each instance is represented by a feature vector. To improve the performance of subsequent data mining algorithms, dimensionality reduction methods can also be applied in this step to reduce the effective number of variables under consideration.</p><p>4. <em>Data mining </em>Once the data is present in a useful format, the initial goal of the process is matched to a particular method, such as classification, regression, or clustering. This step includes deciding which models and parameters might be appropriate (for example, models for categorical data are different than models for numerical data), and matching a particular data mining method with the overall criteria of the KDD process (for example, the end user might be more interested in an interpretable, but less accurate model than a very accurate, but hard to interpret model). Once the data mining method and algorithm are selected, the data mining takes place: searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations, such as rule sets or trees.</p><p>5. <em>Evaluation and interpretation</em></p><p>In the last step, the patterns and models derived by the data mining algorithm(s) are examined with respect to their validity. Furthermore, the user assesses the usefuless of the found knowledge for the given application. This step can also involve visualization of the extracted patterns and models, or visualization of the data using the extracted models.</p><p>The quality of the found patterns depends on the methods being employed in each of these steps, as well as their inter dependencies. Thus, the process model foresees the possibility to go back to each previous step and revise decisions taken at that step, as depicted in Fig.1. This means that the overall process is usually repeated after adjusting the parameterization or even exchanging the methods in any of these steps until the quality of the results is sufficient.</p><figure data-equation="" data-image="5" data-figure-category="figure" data-caption="" id="F53024281" data-image-src="/media/images/971fadf6-df39-4ed8-8b33-4dbb9be2fba9.jpg"><div><img src="971fadf6-df39-4ed8-8b33-4dbb9be2fba9.jpg"/></div><figcaption><span class="figure-cat-figure" data-figure-category="figure">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><p></p></div>

			                <p>As a means to express knowledge about a domain in the SemanticWeb, ontologies have been introduced in the early 1990s as â€˜â€˜explicit formal specifications of the concepts and relations among them that can exist in a given domainâ€™â€™ [12]. For the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, Nigro et al. [13] divide ontologies used in this area into three categories:</p><ul><li><p><em>Domain ontologies</em>: Express background knowledge about the application domain, i.e., the domain of the data at hand on which KDD and data mining are performed.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em>Ontologies for datamining process</em>: Define knowledge about the data mining process, its steps and algorithms and their possible parameters.</p></li><li><p><em>Metadataontologies</em>: Describe meta knowledge about the data at hand, such as provenance information, e.g., the processes used to construct certain datasets.</p><p>It has been already shown that ontologies for the data mining process and metadata ontologies can be used in each step of the KDD process. However, we want to put a stronger focus on the usage of Linked Open Data (LOD) in the process of knowledge discovery, which represents a publicly available interlinked collection of datasets from various topical domains[3,4].</p><p>Fig. 2 gives an overview of the Linked Open Data enabled knowledge discovery pipeline.

In the next step, various techniques for data consolidation, preprocessing and cleaning are applied, e.g., schema matching, data fusion, value normalization, treatment of missing values and outliers, etc. (cf. Section 6). Next, some transformations on the collected data need to be performed in order to represent the data in away that it can be processed with any arbitrary data analysis algorithms (cf. Section 7). Since most algorithms demand a propositional form of the input data, this usually includes a transformation of the graph-based LOD data to a canonical propositional form. After the data transformation is done, a suitable data mining algorithm is selected and applied on the data (cf. Section 8). In the final step, the results of the data mining process are presented to the user.

        We should note that the data can be linked to the LOD datasets in different
stages of the KDD process, for example, in some approaches only the results and the discovered patterns from the data mining process are linked to a given LOD dataset in order to ease the interpretation of them. For simplicityâ€™s sake we describe the process of linking as the first step, which is also depicted in Fig.2.

        We should note that some of the approaches might be applicable in several
steps of the LOD-enabled KDD pipeline. However, in almost all cases, there is one
step which is particularly in the focus of that work, and we categorize those works
under that step.
