<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The radiology report documents and communicates crucial findings in a radiology study. As shown in Figure 1, a standard radiology report usually consists of a Background section that describes the exam and patient information, a Findings section, and an Impression section (Kahn Jr et al., 2009). In a typical workflow, a radiologist first dictates the detailed findings into the report, and then summarizes the salient findings into the more concise Impression section based also on the condition of the patient. The impressions are the most significant part of a radiology report that communicate the findings. Previous studies have shown that over 50% of referring physicians read only the impression statements in a report (Lafortune et al., 1988; Background: history: swelling; pain. technique: 3 views of the left ankle were acquired. comparison: no prior study available. Findings: there is normal mineralization and alignment. no fracture or osseous lesion is identified. the ankle mortise and hindfoot joint spaces are maintained. there is no joint effusion. the soft tissues are normal. Human Impression: normal left ankle radiographs. Extractive Baseline: there is no joint effusion. Pointer-Generator: normal right ankle. Our model: normal radiographs of the left ankle. Figure 1: An example radiology report with study background information organized into a Background Section, and radiology findings in a Findings Section. The human-written summary (or impression) and predicted summaries from different models are also shown. The extractive baseline does not summarize well, the baseline pointer-generator model generates spurious sequence, while our model gives correct summary by incorporating the background information. Bosmans et al., 2011). Despite its importance, the generation of the impression statements is errorprone. For example, crucial findings may be forgotten, which would cause significant miscommunications (Gershanik et al., 2011). Additionally, the process of writing the impression statements is time-consuming and highly repetitive with the dictation of the findings. This suggests a crucial need to automate the radiology impression generation process. In this work, we propose to automate the generation of radiology impressions with neural sequence-to-sequence learning. In particular, we argue that this task could be viewed as a text summarization problem, where the source sequence is the radiology findings and the target sequence the impression statements. We collect a dataset of radiology reports from actual hospital radiographic studies, and find that this task involves both extractive summarization where descriptions of radiology observations can be taken directly from the findings, and abstractive summarization where new words and phrases, such as conclusions of the study, need to be generated from scratch. We empirically evaluate existing popular summarization systems on this task and find that, while existing neural models such as the pointer-generater network can generate plausible summaries, they sometimes fail to model the study background information and thus generate spurious results. To solve this problem, we propose a customized summarization model that properly encodes the study background information and uses the encoded information to guide the decoding process. We show that our model outperforms existing non-neural and neural baselines on our dataset measured by the standard ROUGE metrics. Moreover, in a blind experiment, a board-certified radiologist indicated that 67% of sampled system summaries are at least as good as the reference summaries written by well-trained radiologists, suggesting significant clinical validity of the resulting system. We further show through detailed analysis that our model could be reliably transferred to radiology reports from another organization, and that the model can sometimes summarize radiology studies for body parts unseen during training. To review, our main contributions in this paper include: (i) we propose to summarize radiology findings into impression statements with neural sequence-to-sequence learning, and to our knowledge our work represents the first attempt in this direction; (ii) we propose a new customized summarization model to this task that improves over existing methods by better leveraging study background information; (iii) we further show via a radiologist evaluation that the summaries generated by our model have significant clinical validity. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2RelatedWork> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p><strong>Early Summarization Systems.</strong> Early work on summarization systems mainly focused on extractive approaches, where the summaries are generated by scoring and selecting sentences from the input. Luhn (1958) proposed to represent the input by topic words and score each sentence by the amount of topic words it contains. Kupiec et al. (1995) scored sentences with a feature-based statistical classifier. Steinberger and Jezek (2004) applied latent semantic analysis to cluster the topics and then select sentences that cover the most topics. Meanwhile, various graph-based methods, such as the LexRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and the TextRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004), were applied to model sentence dependency by representing sentences as vertices and similarities as edges. Sentences are then scored and selected via modeling of the graph properties. </p><p><strong>Neural Summarization Systems.</strong> Summarization systems based on neural network models enable abstractive summarization, where new words and phrases are generated to form the summaries. Rush et al. (2015) first applied an attention-based neural encoder and a neural language model decoder to this task. Nallapati et al. (2016) used recurrent neural networks for both the encoder and the decoder. To address the limitation that neural models with a fixed vocabulary cannot handle outof-vocabulary words, a pointer-generator model was proposed which uses an attention mechanism that copies elements directly from the input (Nallapati et al., 2016; Merity et al., 2017; See et al., 2017). See et al. (2017) further proposed a coverage mechanism to address the repetition problem in the generated summaries. Paulus et al. (2018) applied reinforcement learning to summarization and more recently, Chen and Bansal (2018) obtained improved result with a model that first selects sentences and then rewrites them. </p><p><strong>Summarization of Radiology Reports.</strong> Most prior work that attempts to \u201Csummarize\u201D radiology reports focused on classifying and extracting information from the report text (Friedman et al., 1995; Hripcsak et al., 1998; Elkins et al., 2000; Hripcsak et al., 2002). More recently, Hassanpour and Langlotz (2016) studied extracting named entities from multi-institutional radiology reports using traditional feature-based classifiers. Goff and Loehfelm (2018) built an NLP pipeline to identify asserted and negated disease entities in the impression section of radiology reports as a step towards report summarization. Cornegruta et al. (2016) proposed to use a recurrent neural network architecture to model radiological language in solving the medical named entity recognition and negation detection tasks on radiology reports. To our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt at automatic summarization of radiology findings into natural language impression statements. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
