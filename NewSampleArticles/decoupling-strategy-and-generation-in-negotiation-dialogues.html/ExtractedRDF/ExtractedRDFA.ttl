<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2CraigslistNegotiationDataset> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>Previous negotiation datasets were collected in the context of games. For example, Asher et al. (2016) collected chat logs from online Settlers of Catan. Lewis et al. (2017) asked two people to divide a set of hats, books, and balls. While such games are convenient for grounding and evaluation, it restricts the dialogue domain and the richness of the language. Most utterances are direct offers such as \u201Chas anyone got wood for me?\u201D and \u201CI want the ball.\u201D, whereas real-world negotiation would involve more information gathering and persuasion. To encourage more open-ended, realistic negotiation, we propose the CRAIGSLISTBARGAIN task. Two agents are assigned the role of a buyer and a seller; they are asked to negotiate the price of an item for sale on Craigslist given a description and photos. As with the real platform, the listing price is shown to both agents. We additionally suggest a private price to the buyer as a target. Agents chat freely in alternating turns. Either agent can enter an offer price at any time, which can be accepted or rejected by the partner. Agents also have the option to quit, in which case the task is completed with no agreement. To generate the negotiation scenarios, we scraped postings on sfbay.craigslist.org from the 6 most popular categories (housing, furniture, cars, bikes, phones, and electronics). Each posting produces three scenarios with the buyer\u2019s target prices at 0.5x, 0.7x and 0.9x of the listing price. Statistics of the scenarios are shown in Table 2. We collected 6682 human-human dialogues on AMT using the interface shown in Appendix A Figure 2. The dataset statistics in Table 3 show that CRAIGSLISTBARGAIN has longer dialogues and more diverse utterances compared to prior datasets. Furthermore, workers were encouraged to embellish the item and negotiate side offers such as free delivery or pick-up. This highly relatable scenario leads to richer dialogues such as the one shown in Table 1. We also observed various persuasion techniques listed in Table 4 such as embellishment, side offers, and appeals to sympathy. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html> <http://schema.org/name> "Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues" .
<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html> <http://schema.org/abstract> "<p>We consider negotiation settings in which two agents use natural language to bargain on goods. Agents need to decide on both high-level strategy (e.g., proposing $50) and the execution of that strategy (e.g., generating \u201CThe bike is brand new. Selling for just $50!\u201D). Recent work on negotiation trains neural models, but their end-to-end nature makes it hard to control their strategy, and reinforcement learning tends to lead to degenerate solutions. In this paper, we propose a modular approach based on coarse dialogue acts (e.g., propose(price=50)) that decouples strategy and generation. We show that we can flexibly set the strategy using supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or domain-specific knowledge without degeneracy, while our retrieval-based generation can maintain context-awareness and produce diverse utterances. We test our approach on the recently proposed DEALORNODEAL game, and we also collect a richer dataset based on real items on Craigslist. Human evaluation shows that our systems achieve higher task success rate and more human-like negotiation behavior than previous approaches. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>A good negotiator needs to decide on the strategy for achieving a certain goal (e.g., proposing $6000) and the realization of that strategy via generation of natural language (e.g., \u201CI really need a car so I can go to work, but all I have is 6000, any more and I won\u2019t be able to feed my children.\u201D). Most past work in NLP on negotiation focuses on strategy (dialogue management) with either no natural language (Cuayahuitl et al. \u00B4 , 2015; Cao et al., 2018) or canned responses (Keizer et al., 2017; Traum et al., 2008). Recently, end-to-end neural models (Lewis et al., 2017; He et al., 2017) are used to simultaneously learn dialogue strategy and language realization from human-human dialogues, following the trend of using neural network models on both goal-oriented dialogue (Wen et al., 2017a; Dhingra et al., 2017) and opendomain dialogue (Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2017). However, these models have two problems: (i) it is hard to control and interpret the strategies, and (ii) directly optimizing the agent\u2019s goal through reinforcement learning often leads to degenerate solutions where the utterances become ungrammatical (Lewis et al., 2017) or repetitive (Li et al., 2016).<span class=\"comment ref do\" data-id=\"3379904875\" rel=\"schema:hasPart\" resource=\"r-3379904875\" typeof=\"dctypes:Text\"><mark id=\"3379904875\" property=\"schema:description\">\n                         To alleviate these problems, our key idea is to decouple strategy and generation, which gives us control over the strategy such that we can achieve different negotiation goals (e.g., maximizing utility, achieving a fair deal) with the same language generator.\n                    </mark><sup class=\"ref-annotation\">\n    		        <a href=\"#3379904875\" rel=\"cito:hasReplyFrom\" resource=\"http://localhost:8000/document/13//comment-3379904875\">\n       		              \U0001F4AC\n                    </a>\n                </sup></span> Our framework consists of three components shown in Figure 1: First, the parser identifies keywords and entities to map each utterance to a coarse dialogue act capturing the highlevel strategic move. Then, the dialogue manager chooses a responding dialogue act based on a sequence-to-sequence model over coarse dialogue acts learned from parsed training dialogues. Finally, the generator produces an utterance given the dialogue act and the utterance history. Our framework follows that of traditional goaloriented dialogue systems (Young et al., 2013), with one important difference: coarse dialogue acts are not intended to and cannot capture the full meaning of an utterance. As negotiation dialogues are fairly open-ended, the generator needs to depend on the full utterance history. For example, consider the first turn in Figure 1. We cannot generate a response given only the dialogue act inform; we must also look at the previous question. However, we still optimize the dialogue manager in the coarse dialogue act space using supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or domain-specific knowledge. Existing human-human negotiation datasets are grounded in closed-domain games with a fixed set of objects such as Settlers of Catan (lumber, coal, brick, wheat, and sheep) (Afantenos et al., 2012; Asher et al., 2016) or item division (book, hat, and ball) (DeVault et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2017). These objects lack the richness of the real world. To study human negotiation in more open-ended settings that involve real goods, we scraped postings of items for sale from craigslist.org as our negotiation scenario. By hiring workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to play the role of buyers and sellers, we collected a new dataset (CRAIGSLISTBARGAIN) of negotiation dialogues.1 Compared to existing datasets, our more realistic scenario invites richer negotiation behavior involving open-ended aspects such as cheap talk or side offers. We evaluate two families of systems modeling coarse dialogue acts and words respectively, which are optimized by supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or domain knowledge. Each system is evaluated on our new CRAIGSLISTBARGAIN dataset and the DEALORNODEAL dataset of Lewis et al. (2017) by asking AMT workers to chat with the system in an A/B testing setting. We focus on two metrics: task-specific scores (e.g., utility) and human-likeness. We show that reinforcement learning on coarse dialogue acts avoids</p><p>degenerate solutions, which was a problem in Li et al. (2016); Lewis et al. (2017). Our modular model maintains reasonable human-like behavior while still optimizes the objective. Furthermore, we find that models trained over coarse dialogue acts are stronger negotiators (even with only supervised learning) and produce more diverse utterances than models trained over words. Finally, the interpretability of coarse dialogue acts allows system developers to combine the learned dialogue policy with hand-coded rules, thus imposing stronger control over the desired strategy. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
