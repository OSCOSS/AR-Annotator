The SmartEnv ontology is described in terms of its modules representing different aspects including physical and conceptual aspects of a smart environment. We propose the use of the Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) paradigm in order to modularize our proposed solution, while at the same time avoiding strong dependencies between the modules in order to manage the representational complexity of the ontology. The ODP paradigm and related methodologies enable incremental construction of ontologies by first creating and then linking small modules. Most modules (patterns) of the SmartEnv ontology are inspired by, and aligned with, the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, however with extra interlinks to provide further precision and cover more representational aspects. The result is a network of 8 ontology patterns together forming a generic representation for a smart environment. The patterns have been submitted to the ODP portal and are available on-line at stable URIs.</p></section></p><div class="article-part metadata article-keywords"><span class="keyword">Smart Environments</span><span class="keyword"> Ontology Design Pattern</span><span class="keyword"> Semantic Sensor Network</span></div><div class="article-part article-body"><section id="1.Introduction" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#1.Introduction">

			                <p> Applications of sensorized environments that provide domestic monitoring and cognitive assistance services for their inhabitants/users are increasing. An example of such an application is health care monitoring and services, where patients are being monitored and cared for in their own living environment. In order to support the use of artificial intelligence techniques for automating the provision of these services, it is necessary to describe the capabilities of the various aspects of such environments. These descriptions include physical aspects (e.g., the structure of the environment, sensor network setting or entities), as well as conceptual aspects (e.g., events or activities of the users), and can be modeled in ontologies. According to [1], there is a general list of questions about the inhabitants of * smart homes (as an example of smart environments), which many of the suggested knowledge models in the literature aim to address. This list includes questions about the location of the inhabitant, the activity that the inhabitant carries out, the intention behind the activity, the time when the activity is detected, etc. Although the representational models (i.e., ontologies) target the same goal, they differ in terms of the level of generality as well as their reasoning efficiency. <span class="comment ref do" data-id="3183633896" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-3183633896"><mark id="3183633896" property="schema:description">

All rights reserved 2 Alirezaie et al. / SmartEnv as a Network of Ontology Patterns the use of a network of ontology modules, which is called SmartEnv and could be considered as a set of interlinked content Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) [15] due to their generic applicability to the domain and our deliberate effort to minimize their ontological commitments, while maintaining functionality. According to the principles of ODP modeling, the ontological commitments should be minimized by first creating small modules, and then linking them together, instead of designing a large monolithic ontology from scratch as a comprehensive representation of the entire domain [16]. Before going to the details of our proposed ontology, in section 2, we first motivate how and why our suggested SmartEnv ontology is required and compare the available ontologies with the given requirement list. In section 3, we shortly introduce the project whose requirements led us to the development of the SmartEnv ontology in the form of a network of ontology modules. In section 4, we explain the 8 ontology patterns (modules) used in SmartEnv ontology. The SmartEnv ontology, as the result of specializing the relations between modules along with its application is presented in section 5. A discussion on our approach is given in section 6, where the paper is concluded by giving remarks concerning future developments. </p></div>

                        <p>During the requirements analysis process, we considered a number of (conceptual) aspects of smart environments to be covered in the ontologies. For further clarification, some aspects are explained based on a set of high-level competency questions (CQs) (only examples are given here due to space restrictions). The detailed CQs for each of the patterns can be found inside the ODP itself, as annotations of its OWL file, and on its page in the ODP portal: </p><p><strong>Observation/Sensing </strong>Observing (i.e., monitoring) of an object or a place is the main motivation why the environment is sensorized. A representation model is required to answer questions such as what can be observed by a certain sensor? To what object is a sensor attached? What is the location of the object, and what does the sensor measure? Can the sensor or its holding object move? </p><p><strong>Agents</strong> Agents (e.g, inhabitants of a home) are the main characters whose activities, locations, or more specific parameters such as safety and health are usually the main reason behind any observation process in a smart environment. A representation model is required to answer questions such as what are the possible activities of the agent? Can the agent be targeted by sensors? Where is the agent now? What is the agent doing now? </p><p><strong>Activities/Events</strong> Any changes in a smart environment are represented in the form of an event or an activity. Questions such as when an event has occurred, or why such event was recognized, can be answered by representing activities in terms of their preconditions.</p><p><strong>Objects</strong> Physical objects are also directly or indirectly the target of the observation process in order to recognize activities in a smart environment. We represent objects to answer questions about their state (being in a specific situation), locations, or the events or activities in which they are involved. </p><p><strong>Network set-up </strong>In order to set-up a smart environment a sensor network deployment related to the observation process, is indispensable. A network representation model is used to answer any question regarding the hardware and software configuration of a network, its components and their locations. </p><p><strong>Spatial aspect</strong> Any physical entity such as objects, agents, and places in a smart environment has a geometrical aspect based on which their spatial relations with the environment can be represented. </p><p><strong>Temporal aspect</strong> Similar to spatial aspects, the temporal aspects are the main basis of an observation process. A temporal representation model is used to answer questions such as when the occurrence of an activity is realized. It also allows us to define activities based on the temporal relations with their preconditions. </p><p>Given the aforementioned general list of high level concepts required to represent a smart environment, in the following, we overview the literature on the sensor-related ontologies. </p></section><section id="2.2.OverviewofSensor-RelatedOntologies" inlist="" resource="#2.2.OverviewofSensor-RelatedOntologies">
                            <h3 property="schema:name">2.2. Overview of Sensor-Related Ontologies </h3>
                        <p>Sensing and in general sensor-related details of smart environments as one of their integral computational aspects has been widely studied in the Alirezaie et al. / SmartEnv as a Network of Ontology Patterns 3 literature [1, 2, 18]. Although the “re-usability” has always been advertised as an essential features of ontologies, there is a large number of adhocly designed sensor-related ontologies in the literature, many of which are not even available online. This number increases when the idea behind the design of these ontologies is getting more specific, for example for activity recognition purposes [1]. One important task in designing ontologies for smart environments is to identify the activities of an agent in the environment, for instance in the case of a smart home, these could be activities such as “sleeping”, “watching TV”, “cooking” etc. In addition to being able to identify an activity, we also need to represent the time and location where the activity is carried out. Ontologies suggested for recognizing daily activities are rarely relying on upper-level ontologies [19, 20], which usually result in a lower reusability. Concerning the re-usability of ontologies, [3] proposes a top-level ontology that provides a formal and generic representation of activities sharable between different domains. However, apart from the activity representation, in the aforementioned work there is no representation of the other aspects of a smart environment. With the focus on smart environments, [4] introduces the Casas Ontology (COSE) being able to represent sensors, buildings, occupants and human activities, which is publicly available. However, there are no representation details provided to show that the offered light-weight model relies on available upper-level ontologies, or even that it is possible to align it to such ontologies. Furthermore, both the spatial and temporal aspects are poorly represented and there is no support for the representation of the sensor network at all. Likewise, the COBRA-ONT ontology, which also provides a representational model for pervasive computing environments, lacks an alignment with an upper level ontology, and does not contain an explicit temporal representation model [5]. Two other ontologies related to context-awareness in sensorized environments are SOUPA [7] and DogOnt [8]. Although there are a number of working applications of these ontologies, both are lacking some representational aspects. For instance, in SOUPA, we are not able to define devices (as part of the network modules) and their configurations and functionalities. DogOnt also provides a limited object representation with no support for their dynamic features. Comparing with the above mentioned ontologies, the ontology introduced in [6] is more complete in terms of localisation and temporality. It also considers the required representational basis for environmental changes (e.g., events). However, what is missing is again an alignment to an upper level ontology, and although it has been claimed that the ontology is per se generic enough to be used in different domains, it is not obvious how it relates to commonly used upper ontologies and standards. There are also few approaches in the literature proposing more general ontologies for IoT-related domains, regardless of their applications. The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology [21] is introduced as a generic and reusable knowledge model for sensor-related environments. The first version of SSN1 was relying on the upper level ontology DUL2 and took a remarkable step towards the reusability of ontologies [21]. However, the representational details in the first version of SSN could cause an excessive processing query time. That is why some lighter instantiations of SSN, such as IoT-Lite have been introduced [9]. Due to its light weight (in terms of expressivity), IoT-Lite allows us to define some relevant IoT-related concepts to support interoperability of heterogeneous sensor data. Although the vocabularies used in IoT-Lite are aligned with their generalized counterparts, the representation of the key concepts in sensor-related environment that are discussed in section 2.1 such as sensor, action and observation, is limited [26]. Regarding the load of the representational details in SSN bringing up excessive processing time, the W3C Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has proposed an updated version of SSN as a W3C recommendation with no import of the DUL ontology as its basis [12]. The new version of SSN provides a basis for some required concepts (e.g., sensor, observation, platform, etc.) in representing a smart environment. Although the new SSN is not based on DUL, a specific alignment module is also provided, which can be used if needed. In this paper, we propose a generic ontology for smart (sensorized) environments (with at least one inhabitant/user) based on SSN. There are a number of works in the literature inspired by the old version of SSN [22, 23]. However, since the basis of our proposed ontology is the new version of SSN, we do not go through the details of old-SSN-inspired work, as their differences with our proposed ontology will be similar to the differences between the old and new version of SSN. In our design, we rely on 1 https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn 2DOLCE Ultra Light: www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl 4 Alirezaie et al. / SmartEnv as a Network of Ontology Patterns the general concepts given in the new version of the SSN ontology and extend/specialize them in order to cover all the representational requirements given in section 2.1. This extension, which will be explained in the remaining sections of the paper, is focusing on both static (such as objects, deployment or network set-up) and dynamic (such as temporal and spatial, activity and event) concepts. Regarding the design pattern approach, the ODP techniques underpinning our approach make it similar to the work proposed in [25], which introduces a generic Stimulus-Sensor-Observation ontology design pattern for representing observation-based data on the Semantic Web, although their focus is much more limited. Moreover, the focus of the work presented in [26] is on designing a core domain IoT ontology and proposes a reasonable categorization of high level concepts. What makes our approach different, however, is first its more comprehensive coverage of concepts, and also the provided representational details of the aforementioned aspects of a smart environment. As said above, our proposed ontology can be seen as a network of modules whose basis are extracted from SSN. Each module is represented in the form of a pattern, as general as possible with the least possible dependencies on the other patterns. Doing so helps us to realize the main links in the eventual ontology. We can consequently make a stable and at the same time flexible network of concepts that can be updated with the minimum change propagation on the entire ontology, and where individual patterns can also be used in isolation for some specific reasoning tasks (e.g., in order to avoid issues with reasoning complexity or clashes in the relations to foundational ontologies).</p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">( T.
