To enrich the proposed knowledge graph, we also perform entity alignment with existing databases and rule-based inference.

			                <p>Knowledge graphs have become very crucial resources to support many AI related applications, such as graph analytics, Q&amp;A system, web search, etc. A knowledge graph, which describes and stores facts as triples, is a multi-relational graph consisting of entities as nodes and relations as different types of edges. Nowadays, many companies and research teams are trying to organize the knowledge in their domain into a machine-readable knowledge graph, e.g., YAGO [6], NELL [9], DBpedia [7], and DeepDive [2]. Although these large-scale knowledge graphs have collected tremendous amount of factual information about the world, many fields still remain to be covered.</p><p>With information of papers, scholars, institutes, venues, fields of study and other useful entities, data mining on academic networks aims to discover hidden relations and to nd semantic-based information. Several academic databases or knowledge graphs have been built with structured academic data [12, 13, 16]. e public academic knowledge graphs can provide scholars with convincing academic information, and oer large-scale benchmark datasets for researchers to conduct data mining projects.</p><p>However, there are some limitations in existing databases or knowledge graphs. First, most of existing works provide homogeneous academic graphs, while relations among different types of entities remaining lost [12, 16]. Second, some databases only concentrate on one specic eld of study, limiting the projects which aim at discovering cross-eld knowledge [12]. Third, synonymy and ambiguity are also the restrictions for knowledge mining [13]. Allocating the unique IDs to the entities is the necessary solution, but some databases use the names of the entities as their IDs directly.</p><p>In this paper, we propose <span class="comment ref do" data-id="1788823889" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-1788823889"><mark id="1788823889" property="schema:description">

                        <p>All objects (e.g., papers, institutes, authors) are represented as entities in the AceKG. Two entities can stand in a relation. Commonly used attributes of each entities including numbers, dates, strings and other literals are represented as well. Similar entities are grouped into classes. In total, AceKG denes 5 classes of academic entities: <em>Papers, Authors, Fields of study, Venues and Institutes</em>. And the facts including the frequently used properties of each entities and the relations between the entities are described as triples in the knowledge graph. e ontology of AceKG is shown in Figure 1. To deal with synonymy and ambiguity, each entity in defined classes are allocated with a URI. For example, ace:7E7A3A69 and ace:7E0D6766 are two scholars having the same name: Jiawei Han, one of whom is the inuential data mining scientist. Compared with the datasets which use entity names to represent entities directly, AceKG can avoid mistakes caused by synonymy and ambiguity, the statistics of AceKG are shown in Table 1. All the facts are represented as subject - predicate - object triples (SPO triples). And we release the Turtle format AceKG online.

                        <p>Given a set S of triples (h, r, t) composed of two entities h,t ∈ E (the set of entities) and a relation r ∈ R (the set of relationships), knowledge embedding maps each entity to a k-dimensional vector in the embedding space, and denes a scoring function to evaluate the plausibility of the triple (h, r, t) in the knowledge graph.  We study and evaluate related methods on link prediction problem defined in [1]: given one of the entities and the relation in a latent triple, the task is to predict the other missed entity. The commonly used benchmark datasets are FB15K and WN18, which are extracted from Freebase [4] and WordNet [8]. We construct a new benchmark dataset (denoted as AK18K in the rest of this section) extracted from AceKG for knowledge embedding.  We will show how it differs from FB15K and WN18 in Section 3.2. We compare the following algorithms in our experiments: TransE [1], TransH [18], DistMult[19], ComplEx [17], HolE [10].</p></section><section id="3.2ExperimentalSetup" inlist="" resource="#3.2ExperimentalSetup">

                        <p>To extract AK18K from AceKG, we rst select 68 critical international venues (conferences and journals) and inuential papers published on them. en we add the triples of authors, elds and institutes. Finally, the train/valid/test datasets are divided randomly. Table 3 shows the statistics of the WN18, FB15K and AK18K. AK18K is sparser than FB15K but denser than WN18 (indicated by the value of #Trip/#E), and it provides only 7 types of relations. We will evaluate the models’ scalability on the knowledge graph which has simple relation structure but tremendous amount of entities. The code we used is based on the OpenKE [5], an open-source framework for knowledge embedding.</p></section><section id="3.3EvaluationResults" inlist="" resource="#3.3EvaluationResults">

                        <p>We show the link prediction results based on knowledge embedding in Table 4. e reported results are produced with the best set of hyper-parameters aer the grid searches reported in the papers. The compared state-of-the-art models can be divided into two categories: (i) translational models (TransE, TransH); (ii) compositional models (DistMult, HolE, ComplEx). TransE outperforms all counterparts on hit@10 as 89.2%. Although 94.4% of relations in our knowledge graph are many-to-many, which works for TransH, TransE shows its advantages on modeling sparse and simple knowledge graph, while TransH fails to achieve beer results.  e reason may be the number of relationship types is only 7, which is small.  On the other hand, HolE and ComplEx achieve the most significant performances on the other metrics, especially on hit@1 (83.8% and 75.4%) and on ltered MRR (0.482 and 0.440), which confirms their advantages on modeling antisymmetric relations because all of our relations are antisymmetric, such as <em>field_is_part_of</em> and <em>paper_is_written_by</em> .</p><p>Compared with the experiment results on FB15K and WN18 reported in [10], performances evaluated using AK18K are noticeably different. First, results on AK18K are lower than those on WN18 but higher than those on FB15K. It is caused by the limited relation types and large amount of potential entities per relation.  Some relation such as paper is in field can have thousands of possible objects per triple, limiting the prediction performance. Second, the performance gap between two model categories grows more pronounced as the knowledge graph become more complicated, which indicates the translational models with simple assumptions may not model the complicated graph well.</p><p></p></section><section id="4NETWORKREPRESENTATIONLEARNING" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#4NETWORKREPRESENTATIONLEARNING">

                        <p>Based on AceKG, we rst select 5 elds of study (FOS) 5 and 5 main subfields of each. en we extract all scholars, papers and venues in those fields of study respectively to construct 5 heterogeneous collaboration networks. We also construct 2 larger academic knowledge graph: (i) we integrate 5 networks above into one graph which contains all the information of 5 fields of study; (ii) we match the eight categories of venues in Google Scholar to those in AceKG.  151 of 160 venues (8 categories × 20 per category) are successfully matched.  en we select all the related papers and scholars to construct one large heterogeneous collaboration networks. The statistics of these networks are shown in Table 5. Moreover, the category of scholars are labeled with the following approach:</p><ol><li><p>To label the papers, we adopt the eld of study information and Google scholar category directly as the label of papers in 6 FOS networks and 1 Google scholar network respectively.</p></li><li><p>As for the label of the scholars, it is determined by the majority of his/her publications’ labels.

                        <p>We adopt logistic regression to conduct scholar classication tasks. Note that in this task 5-fold cross validation are adopted. Table 6 shows the classication results evaluated by Micro-F1 and Macro-F1.  metapath2vec learns heterogeneous node embeddings signicantly beer than other methods. We attribute it to the modied heterogeneous sampling and skip-gram algorithm. However, DeepWalk and LINE also achieve comparable performance, showing their scalability on heterogeneous networks.</p><p>Another reason for the comparable performance is that our edge types and node types are limited, thus algorithms on homogeneous information network can also learn a comprehensive network representation.</p><p>It should be noted that there is signicant performance gap between FOS-labeled datasets and the Google-labeled dataset, which is because of the dierent distribution of papers and scholars. Papers collected in the Google-labeled dataset are published in Top-venues and consequently few scholar could be active in multiple categories, while there are more cross-eld papers and scholars in FOS-labeled datasets.</p><p>Moreover, the performance indicates the level of interdiscipline in these fields. For example, the highest Micro-F1 shows that the sub-fields of Biology are the most independent, while the lowest Micro-F1 means that the sub-fields of CS cross mostly.  Finally, the dramatical decline from Micro-F1 to Macro-F1, especially in Economy, indicates the imbalance of sub-elds in some FOS. </p></section><section id="4.3.2Clustering." resource="#4.3.2Clustering.">

                        <p>Based on the same node representation in scholar classication task, we further conduct scholar clustering experiment with k-means algorithm to evaluate the models’ performance. All clustering experiments are conducted 10 times and the average performance is reported.</p><p>Table 7 shows the clustering results evaluated by normalized mutual information (NMI). Overall, metapath2vec outperforms all the other models, indicating the modied heterogeneous sampling and skip-gram algorithm can preserve the information of the knowledge graph beer.  Another interesting result is the performance gap between FOS-labeled dataset and Google-labeled dataset, which indicates the hypothesis we proposed in section 4.3.1.</p></section><section id="5FUTUREDIRECTIONS" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#5FUTUREDIRECTIONS">

In this section, we propose three potential directions.</p><p>Cooperation prediction.<span class="comment ref do" data-id="1158357137" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-1158357137"><mark id="1158357137" property="schema:description">

                </sup></span> However, all these factors can be thought as obvious features in an academic knowledge graph, which is incomplete and may always ignore some other features like the same institution or the same eld. Given this situation, one may perform cooperation prediction based on the NRL results, which can represent the features of a researcher beer and may provide some help to cooperation prediction task.</p><p><strong>Author disambiguation</strong>. Author disambiguation is a traditional problem in social network, which means distinguishing two people with the same name in a network.  With the help of AceKG, author disambiguation can be conducted conveniently. e network structure and node aributes in AceKG can enhance the author disambiguation performance. en, some author disambiguation algorithms with good performance can be applied to AceKG. The author disambiguation problem can be solved and the quality of AceKG will be improved in such an iterative way.</p><p><strong>Finding rising star</strong>. Finding academic rising star is important in academic mining in that it can provide helpful reference for universities and companies to hire young faculty or new scientist. Researchers have raised various algorithms for this based on publication increasing rate, mentoring relations and some other factors.</p><p>In order to make the classification beer, we can firstly embed the AceKG to uncover the hidden features of rising star and then apply some clustering algorithms on the embedding results.</p></div>

Based on AceKG, we design three experimental evaluations and further compare several state-of-the-art approaches on AceKG.
