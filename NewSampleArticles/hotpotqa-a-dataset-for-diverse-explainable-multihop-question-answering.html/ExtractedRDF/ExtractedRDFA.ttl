<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2DataCollection> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The main goal of our work is to collect a diverse and explainable question answering dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning. One way to do so is to define reasoning chains based on a knowledge base (Welbl et al., 2018; Talmor and Berant, 2018). However, the resulting datasets are limited by the incompleteness of entity relations and the lack of diversity in the question types. Instead, in this work, we focus on text-based question answering in order to diversify the questions and answers. The overall setting is that given some context paragraphs (e.g., a few paragraphs, or the entire Web) and a question, a QA system answers the question by extracting a span of text from the context, similar to Rajpurkar et al. (2016). We additionally ensure that it is necessary to perform multi-hop reasoning to correctly answer the question. It is non-trivial to collect text-based multi-hop questions. In our pilot studies, we found that simply giving an arbitrary set of paragraphs to crowd workers is counterproductive, because for most paragraph sets, it is difficult to ask a meaningful multi-hop question. To address this challenge, we carefully design a pipeline to collect text-based multi-hop questions. Below, we will highlight the key design choices in our pipeline.</p><p><strong> Building a Wikipedia Hyperlink Graph</strong>. We use the entire English Wikipedia dump as our corpus.2 In this corpus, we make two observations: (1) hyper-links in the Wikipedia articles often naturally entail a relation between two (already disambiguated) entities in the context, which could potentially be used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning; (2) the first paragraph of each article often contains much information that could be queried in a meaningful way. Based on these observations, we extract all the hyperlinks from the first paragraphs of all Wikipedia articles. With these hyperlinks, we build a directed graph G, where each edge (a, b) indicates there is a hyperlink from the first paragraph of article a to article b. </p><p><strong>Generating Candidate Paragraph Pairs.</strong> To generate meaningful pairs of paragraphs for multihop question answering with G, we start by considering an example question \u201Cwhen was the singer and songwriter of Radiohead born?\u201D To 2https://dumps.wikimedia.org/ answer this question, one would need to first reason that the \u201Csinger and songwriter of Radiohead\u201D is \u201CThom Yorke\u201D, and then figure out his birthday in the text. We call \u201CThom Yorke\u201D a bridge entity in this example. Given an edge (a, b) in the hyperlink graph G, the entity of b can usually be viewed as a bridge entity that connects a and b. As we observe articles b usually determine the theme of the shared context between a and b, but not all articles b are suitable for collecting multihop questions. For example, entities like countries are frequently referred to in Wikipedia, but don\u2019t necessarily have much in common with all incoming links. It is also difficult, for instance, for the crowd workers to ask meaningful multihop questions about highly technical entities like the IPv4 protocol. To alleviate this issue, we constrain the bridge entities to a set of manually curated pages in Wikipedia (see Appendix A). After curating a set of pages B, we create candidate paragraph pairs by sampling edges (a, b) from the hyperlink graph such that b \u2208 B. </p><p><strong>Comparison Questions.</strong> In addition to questions collected using bridge entities, we also collect another type of multi-hop questions\u2014 comparison questions. The main idea is that comparing two entities from the same category usually results in interesting multi-hop questions, e.g., \u201CWho has played for more NBA teams, Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant?\u201D To facilitate collecting this type of question, we manually curate 42 lists of similar entities (denoted as L) from Wikipedia.3 To generate candidate paragraph pairs, we randomly sample two paragraphs from the same list and present them to the crowd worker. To increase the diversity of multi-hop questions, we also introduce a subset of yes/no questions in comparison questions. This complements the original scope of comparison questions by offering new ways to require systems to reason over both paragraphs. For example, consider the entities Iron Maiden (from the UK) and AC/DC (from Australia). Questions like \u201CIs Iron Maiden or AC/DC from the UK?\u201D are not ideal, because one would deduce the answer is \u201CIron Maiden\u201D even if one only had access to that article. With yes/no questions, one may ask \u201CAre Iron Maiden and AC/DC from the same country?\u201D, which re- 3This is achieved by manually curating lists from the Wikipedia \u201CList of lists of lists\u201D (https://wiki.sh/ y8qv). One example is \u201CHighest Mountains on Earth\u201D. Algorithm 1 Overall data collection procedure Input: question type ratio r1 = 0.75, yes/no ratio r2 = 0.5 while not finished do if random() &lt; r1 then Uniformly sample an entity b \u2208 B Uniformly sample an edge (a, b) Workers ask a question about paragraphs a and b else Sample a list from L, with probabilities weighted by list sizes Uniformly sample two entities (a, b) from the list if random() &lt; r2 then Workers ask a yes/no question to compare a and b else Workers ask a question with a span answer to compare a and b end if end if Workers provide the supporting facts end while quires reasoning over both paragraphs. To the best of our knowledge, text-based comparison questions are a novel type of questions that have not been considered by previous datasets. More importantly, answering these questions usually requires arithmetic comparison, such as comparing ages given birth dates, which presents a new challenge for future model development. </p><p><strong>Collecting Supporting Facts.</strong> To enhance the explainability of question answering systems, we want them to output a set of supporting facts necessary to arrive at the answer, when the answer is generated. To this end, we also collect the sentences that determine the answers from crowd workers. These supporting facts can serve as strong supervision for what sentences to pay attention to. Moreover, we can now test the explainability of a model by comparing the predicted supporting facts to the ground truth ones. The overall procedure of data collection is illustrated in Algorithm 1. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#4DatasetAnalysis> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>In this section, we analyze the types of questions, types of answers, and types of multi-hop reasoning covered in the dataset. </p><p><strong>Question Types</strong>. We heuristically identified question types for each collected question. To identify the question type, we first locate the central question word (CQW) in the question. Since HOTPOTQA contains comparison questions and 5As we required the crowd workers to use complete entity names in the question, the majority of the questions are unambiguous in the full wiki setting. Figure 2: Types of questions covered in HOTPOTQA. Question types are extracted heuristically, starting at question words or prepositions preceding them. Empty colored blocks indicate suffixes that are too rare to show individually. See main text for more details. yes/no questions, we consider as question words WH-words, copulas (\u201Cis\u201D, \u201Care\u201D), and auxiliary verbs (\u201Cdoes\u201D, \u201Cdid\u201D). Because questions often involve relative clauses beginning with WH-words, we define the CQW as the first question word in the question if it can be found in the first three tokens, or the last question word otherwise. Then, we determine question type by extracting words up to 2 tokens away to the right of the CQW, along with the token to the left if it is one of a few common prepositions (e.g., in the cases of \u201Cin which\u201D and \u201Cby whom\u201D). We visualize the distribution of question types in Figure 2, and label the ones shared among more than 250 questions. As is shown, our dataset covers a diverse variety of questions centered around entities, locations, events, dates, and numbers, as well as yes/no questions directed at comparing two entities (\u201CAre both A and B ...?\u201D), to name a few. </p><p><strong>Answer Types</strong>. We further sample 100 examples from the dataset, and present the types of answers in Table 2. As can be seen, HOTPOTQA covers a broad range of answer types, which matches our initial analysis of question types. We find that a majority of the questions are about entities in the articles (68%), and a non-negligible amount of questions also ask about various properties like date (9%) and other descriptive properties such as numbers (8%) and adjectives (4%). Answer Type % Example(s) Person 30 King Edward II, Rihanna Group / Org 13 Cartoonito, Apalachee Location 10 Fort Richardson, California Date 9 10th or even 13th century Number 8 79.92 million, 17 Artwork 8 Die schweigsame Frau Yes/No 6 - Adjective 4 conservative Event 1 Prix Benois de la Danse Other proper noun 6 Cold War, Laban Movement Analysis Common noun 5 comedy, both men and women Table 2: Types of answers in HOTPOTQA. </p><p><strong>Multi-hop Reasoning Types</strong>. <span class=\"comment ref do\" data-id=\"2134101915\" rel=\"schema:hasPart\" resource=\"r-2134101915\" typeof=\"dctypes:Text\"><mark id=\"2134101915\" property=\"schema:description\">\n                        We also sampled 100 examples from the dev and test sets and manually classified the types of reasoning required to answer each question.

A majority of sampled questions (42%) require chain reasoning (Type I in the table), where the reader must first identify a bridge entity before the second hop can be answered by filling in the bridge. One strategy to answer these questions would be to decompose them into consecutive single-hop questions. The bridge entity could also be used implicitly to help infer properties of other entities related to it. In some questions (Type III), the entity in question shares certain properties with a bridge entity (e.g., they are collocated), and we can infer its properties through the bridge entity. Another type of question involves locating the answer entity by satisfying multiple properties simultaneously (Type II). Here, to answer the question, one could find the set of all entities that satisfy each of the properties mentioned, and take an intersection to arrive at the final answer. Questions comparing two entities (Comparison) also require the system to understand the properties in question about the two entities (e.g., nationality), and sometimes require arithmetic such as counting (as seen in the table) or comparing numerical values (\u201CWho is older, A or B?\u201D). Finally, we find that sometimes the questions require more than two supporting facts to answer (Other). In our analysis, we also find that for all of the examples shown in the table, the supporting facts provided by the Turkers match exactly with the limited context shown here.</p><figure data-caption=\"\" data-equation=\"\" data-figure-category=\"figure\" data-image=\"3\" data-image-src=\"/media/images/2cf32268-6c56-4e31-a9a3-020e6b68a981.jpg\" id=\"F78049961\"><div><img src=\"2cf32268-6c56-4e31-a9a3-020e6b68a981.jpg\"/></div><figcaption><span class=\"figure-cat-figure\" data-figure-category=\"figure\">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]\">(Chen, Fisch, Weston, &amp; Bordes., 2017)</span></p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The ability to perform reasoning and inference over natural language is an important aspect of intelligence. The task of question answering (QA) provides a quantifiable and objective way to test the reasoning ability of intelligent systems. To this end, a few large-scale QA datasets have been proposed, which sparked significant progress in this direction. However, existing datasets have limitations that hinder further advancements of machine reasoning over natural language, especially in testing QA systems\u2019 ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, where the system has to reason with information taken from more than one document to arrive at the answer. \u2217These authors contributed equally. The order of authorship is decided through dice rolling. \u2020Work done when WWC was at CMU. Paragraph A, Return to Olympus: [1] Return to Olympus is the only album by the alternative rock band Malfunkshun. [2] It was released after the band had broken up and after lead singer Andrew Wood (later of Mother Love Bone) had died of a drug overdose in 1990. [3] Stone Gossard, of Pearl Jam, had compiled the songs and released the album on his label, Loosegroove Records. Paragraph B, Mother Love Bone: [4] Mother Love Bone was an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1987. [5] The band was active from 1987 to 1990. [6] Frontman Andrew Wood\u2019s personality and compositions helped to catapult the group to the top of the burgeoning late 1980s/early 1990s Seattle music scene. [7] Wood died only days before the scheduled release of the band\u2019s debut album, \u201CApple\u201D, thus ending the group\u2019s hopes of success. [8] The album was finally released a few months later. Q: What was the former band of the member of Mother Love Bone who died just before the release of \u201CApple\u201D? A: Malfunkshun Supporting facts: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 Figure 1: An example of the multi-hop questions in HOTPOTQA. We also highlight the supporting facts in blue italics, which are also part of the dataset. First, some datasets mainly focus on testing the ability of reasoning within a single paragraph or document, or single-hop reasoning. For example, in SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) questions are designed to be answered given a single paragraph as the context, and most of the questions can in fact be answered by matching the question with a single sentence in that paragraph. As a result, it has fallen short at testing systems\u2019 ability to reason over a larger context. TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and SearchQA (Dunn et al., 2017) create a more challenging setting by using information retrieval to collect multiple documents to form the context given existing question-answer pairs. Nevertheless, most of the questions can be answered by matching the question with a few nearby sentences in one single paragraph, which is limited as it does not require more complex reasoning (e.g., over multiple paragraphs). Second, existing datasets that target multi-hop reasoning, such as QAngaroo (Welbl et al., 2018) and COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS (Talmor and Berant, 2018), are constructed using existing knowledge bases (KBs). As a result, these datasets are constrained by the schema of the KBs they use, and therefore the diversity of questions and answers is inherently limited. Third, all of the above datasets only provide distant supervision; i.e., the systems only know what the answer is, but do not know what supporting facts lead to it. This makes it difficult for models to learn about the underlying reasoning process, as well as to make explainable predictions. To address the above challenges, we aim at creating a QA dataset that requires reasoning over multiple documents, and does so in natural language, without constraining itself to an existing knowledge base or knowledge schema. We also want it to provide the system with strong supervision about what text the answer is actually derived from, to help guide systems to perform meaningful and explainable reasoning. We present HOTPOTQA1 , a large-scale dataset that satisfies these desiderata. HOTPOTQA is collected by crowdsourcing based on Wikipedia articles, where crowd workers are shown multiple supporting context documents and asked explicitly to come up with questions requiring reasoning about all of the documents. This ensures it covers multi-hop questions that are more natural, and are not designed with any pre-existing knowledge base schema in mind. Moreover, we also ask the crowd workers to provide the supporting facts they use to answer the question, which we also provide as part of the dataset (see Figure 1 for an example). We have carefully designed a data collection pipeline for HOTPOTQA, since the collection of high-quality multi-hop questions is nontrivial. We hope that this pipeline also sheds light on future work in this direction. Finally, we also collected a novel type of questions\u2014comparison questions\u2014as part of HOTPOTQA, in which we require systems to compare two entities on some shared properties to test their understanding of both language and common concepts such as numerical magnitude. We make HOTPOTQA publicly available at https://HotpotQA.github.io. 1The name comes from the first three authors\u2019 arriving at the main idea during a discussion at a hot pot restaurant. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

Specifically, we randomly sampled questions (\u223C3\u201310 per Turker) from top-contributing turkers, and categorized all 4https://www.mturk.com/ Name Desc. Usage # Examples train-easy single-hop training 18,089 train-medium multi-hop training 56,814 train-hard hard multi-hop training 15,661 dev hard multi-hop dev 7,405 test-distractor hard multi-hop test 7,405 test-fullwiki hard multi-hop test 7,405 Total 112,779 Table 1: Data split. The splits train-easy, trainmedium, and train-hard are combined for training. The distractor and full wiki settings use different test sets so that the gold paragraphs in the full wiki test set remain unknown to any models. their questions into the train-easy set if an overwhelming percentage in the sample only required reasoning over one of the paragraphs. We sampled these turkers because they contributed more than 70% of our data. This train-easy set contains 18,089 mostly single-hop examples. We implemented a question answering model based on the current state-of-the-art architectures, which we discuss in detail in Section 5.1. Based on this model, we performed a three-fold cross validation on the remaining multi-hop examples. Among these examples, the models were able to correctly answer 60% of the questions with high confidence (determined by thresholding the model loss). These correctly-answered questions (56,814 in total, 60% of the multi-hop examples) are split out and marked as the train-medium subset, which will also be used as part of our training set. After splitting out train-easy and train-medium, we are left with hard examples. As our ultimate goal is to solve multi-hop question answering, we focus on questions that the latest modeling techniques are not able to answer. Thus we constrain our dev and test sets to be hard examples. Specifically, we randomly divide the hard examples into four subsets, train-hard, dev, test-distractor, and test-fullwiki. Statistics about the data split can be found in Table 1. In Section 5, we will show that combining train-easy, train-medium, and trainhard to train models yields the best performance, so we use the combined set as our default training set. The two test sets test-distractor and testfullwiki are used in two different benchmark settings, which we introduce next. We create two benchmark settings. In the first setting, to challenge the model to find the true supporting facts in the presence of noise, for each example we employ bigram tf-idf (Chen et al., 2017) to retrieve 8 paragraphs from Wikipedia as distractors, using the question as the query. We mix them with the 2 gold paragraphs (the ones used to collect the question and answer) to construct the distractor setting. The 2 gold paragraphs and the 8 distractors are shuffled before they are fed to the model. In the second setting, we fully test the model\u2019s ability to locate relevant facts as well as reasoning about them by requiring it to answer the question given the first paragraphs of all Wikipedia articles without the gold paragraphs specified. This full wiki setting truly tests the performance of the systems\u2019 ability at multi-hop reasoning in the wild.5 The two settings present different levels of difficulty, and would require techniques ranging from reading comprehension to information retrieval. As shown in Table 1, we use separate test sets for the two settings to avoid leaking information, because the gold paragraphs are available to a model in the distractor setting, but should not be accessible in the full wiki setting. We also try to understand the model\u2019s good performance on the train-medium split. Manual analysis shows that the ratio of multi-hop questions in train-medium is similar to that of the hard examples (93.3% in train-medium vs. 92.0% in dev), but one of the question types appears more frequently in train-medium compared to the hard splits (Type II: 32.0% in train-medium vs. 15.0% in dev, see Section 4 for the definition of Type II questions). These observations demonstrate that given enough training data, existing neural architectures can be trained to answer certain types and certain subsets of the multi-hop questions. However, train-medium remains challenging when not just the gold paragraphs are present\u2014we show in Appendix C that the retrieval problem on these examples are as difficult as that on their hard cousins. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
