In order to meet the energy sustainability and minimize the climate change, the European Commission agreed a set of binding legislations inside the EU 2020 package. One of the spotlighted sectors re- *Corresponding author, e-mail: iker.esnaola@tekniker.es garding this package is the building sector which, according to the UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), consumes about 40% of global energy and is responsible for 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. Therefore, efficient management of building energy plays a vital role and is becoming the trend for a future generation of buildings. However, energy efficiency is not the only concern related with buildings. Since approximately 90% of people spend most of their time in buildings, feeling comfortable indoors is a must and poses a huge impact to preserve inhabitant’s health, morale, working efficiency, productivity and satisfaction. As a conse1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 c 0 – IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 I. Esnaola-Gonzalez et al. / Semantic Prediction Assistant Approach applied to Energy Efficiency in Tertiary Buildings quence, a system is needed which fulfils the occupants’ expected comfort index whilst reducing energy consumption during the operation of a building. In this context, the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) techniques will lead to both researching the reduction of such prominent impact and the improvement of comfort levels. The achievement of energy efficiency while maintaining users’ comfort in tertiary buildings is not a trivial question. There are many complementary ways to save and optimize energy use in buildings, but since temperature is the most important ambient parameter affecting electric load, forecasted indoor temperatures constitute a basic ingredient in energy efficiency plans [1]. Let us consider the following scenario. The facility manager of a given building seeks to establish an activation strategy for the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system, so that energy is used in the most efficient way while maintaining the optimal comfort1 levels for the space occupants. In order to support prescriptive HVAC control strategies, space temperature predictions can be used as a base. That is, temperature of the space is predicted simulating the activation of HVAC system resources within the space at different times and intensities (e.g. activating all of them for four hours, activating half of them for six hours, etc.). Keeping this in mind, the facility manager requests a KDD process to obtain a temperature predictor model for the space under study. The KDD can be understood as a five steps process leading to the extraction of useful knowledge from raw data [27], applicable for instance in decision support systems. The five steps can be summarized as follows: 1. Selection of datasets and subset of variables or data samples on which discovery will be performed. 2. Preprocessing tasks to ensure data quality and preparation for a subsequent analysis. 3. Transformation or production of a projection of the data to a form which data mining algorithms can work with and improve their performance. 4. Data mining by selecting the algorithm that best matches the user’s goals and their application to search for hidden patterns. 1Optimal comfort can be understood in many ways: a temperature that ranges between some given values, a temperature that varies less during a period of time, etc. 5. Interpretation and evaluation of the results, patterns and models derived, in support of decision making processes. This process can involve significant iteration and can contain loops between any two of the mentioned steps as can be seen in Figure 1. Data analysts in charge of the KDD process are confronted with large, diverse and heterogeneous data. First of all, data related to the given space and its structural element properties including materials, heat transfer coefficients, and orientation of their boundaries. They also need to take into account information about sensors and actuators deployed in the building, their location, features and certainly their measurements. Likewise, data about weather conditions and weather forecasts for the building location are relevant. Furthermore, there is other information to consider such as the space occupancy, work schedule or human related organization. <span class="comment ref do" data-id="888778034" rel="schema:hasPart" typeof="dctypes:Text" resource="r-888778034"><mark id="888778034" property="schema:description">

Consequently, they typically resort to a trial and error approach searching for variables and tasks that could be confidently used to make accurate predictions. This is definitely an undesirable approach and it would be much more profitable to count with an assisted KDD process supported by technologies that enable the management of data semantics, data interrelationships, and knowledge representation. Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) enable the explicit representation of knowledge both in human and machine understandable form. Moreover, SWT have been successfully used in the data integration as well as system interoperability tasks, and they enable the representation of expert knowledge obtained via knowledge elicitation processes. Once represented in semantic resources, SWT open a range of possibilities to exploit knowledge, such as full fledged data querying or further processing to infer new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Furthermore, if domain expert knowledge is adequately complemented with tools that support the assistance throughout the KDD process, its usability and exploitation capabilities will be at hand. This paper presents the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) process to address the aforementioned problematic scenario in the energy efficiency in tertiary buildings domain, leverag- I.

An overview of the steps that compose the KDD Process proposed in [27]. ing Semantic Web Technologies such as ontologies, ontology-driven rules and ontology-driven data access. The EEPSA process targets different KDD phases and each one poses its requirements. First of all, data needs to be semantically annotated with appropriated ontological terms. This semantic annotation is fundamental for enriching data, integrating heterogeneous data and representing it in a more domain-oriented way, as well as for enabling the improvement of the upcoming KDD phases. In the data selection phase the data analyst is assisted to decide which might be the most relevant variables for the matter at hand. Ontology-driven queries and inferencing capabilities support this task. The preprocessing phase intends to clean data from noise, missing values or inconsistencies to name a few. Ontology-driven rules help detecting such problematic data and classifying them according to their potential cause, as well as in proposing possible methods to fix them according to the established goal. The transformation phase generates additional knowledge in form of new attributes. Knowledgedriven rules, inferencing capabilities and external data sources are critical in this phase. All the enhancements in these phases could contribute to improve the robustness and performance of machine learning algorithms applied in the data mining phase and would ease the interpretation of the obtained results. Moreover, the proposed process is expected to be reusable in similar use cases of the same domain due to its high abstraction level. Summarizing, the main contributions of this paper are the following: – Description of a domain ontology that provides enough concepts and relations to express all the relevant information for the identified tasks and enables the representation of actionable expert knowledge. – Outline of a process for assisting data analysts throughout a KDD process by leveraging SWT, with focus on some phases to show the mechanics of this proposal. – A real-world evaluation of the proposed approach for illustrating the process. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work and analyses existing ontologies in the field. Section 3 presents the EEPSA ontology and the EEPSA process through the different KDD phases. Section 4 shows the application of this process on a real-world use case and evaluates and discusses obtained results. Finally the conclusions of this work are shown in section 5.</p><figure data-equation="" data-image="21" data-figure-category="figure" data-caption="" id="F12663421" data-image-src="/media/images/db4e911c-0f88-4db5-91ec-f01669abdd00.jpg"><div><img src="db4e911c-0f88-4db5-91ec-f01669abdd00.jpg"/></div><figcaption><span class="figure-cat-figure" data-figure-category="figure">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">( E.
