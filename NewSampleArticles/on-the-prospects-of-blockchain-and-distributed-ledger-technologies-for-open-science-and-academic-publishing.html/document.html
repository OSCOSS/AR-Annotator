			                <p>Simply put, a distributed ledger is a collaboratively managed database of shared, synchronized, and replicated records that typically does not rely on central governance. The ledger is maintained by a network of nodes that store and verify records, e.g., to prevent double-spending. While the popularity of the blockbased Bitcoin often leads to the impression that distributed ledger technologies mainly target the financial market and rely on a (block)chain layout for the ledger, the sector is much more diverse both technically and in terms of the addressed application areas [1]. These range from authentication and rights *Corresponding author. E-mail: janowicz@ucsb.edu. management, data storage (including handling medical records [2, 3]), credit scoring and risk modeling [4], cloud computing, data provenance [5], e-voting, forecasting, commodity markets [6], and supply chain management [7] to shared business applications [8]. Many ledgers available today are open in the sense that everybody can contribute to them, e.g., by having their transactions included or by casting a vote, as well as in the sense that everybody can run a node. Consequently, the resulting network of nodes is distributed globally thereby spanning across cultures, physical factors such as climate zones, and jurisdictions. This is a key factor in the success of these systems as it increases their resilience, e.g., changes in local law or natural disasters do not immediately impact the entire system.</p><p>While distributed ledgers and their underlying technologies are easily confused with what is nowadays called crypto-currencies (or coins), they are not the same. For instance, blockchain describes the data structure by which transactions (i.e., messages that alter the state of the ledger) are bundled into blocks of a certain maximum size (for the sake of performance) and then cryptographically linked to a growing list. Bitcoin, in contrast, is a crypto-currency that makes use of this blockchain data structure. Additionally, there are many other aspects that describe and define the workings of a crypto-currency, e.g., protocols, clients, such as wallets used to store coins, smart contracts, consensus measures, and so forth. As a result, there are many ways in which all of these components can be combined to arrive at a final ecosystem. To date, this has resulted in more than 1500 coins, most of which see little to no uptake. Finally, many of these components change during the lineage of a coin, sometimes causing disagreement between supporting parties and ultimately leading to a diverging chain split (called a fork) which creates a new coin. It follows that the community forming around a particular ecosystem is its greatest asset. After all, hundreds or thousands of people have to trust the system to a degree where they are willing to invest their time, hardware, money, reputation, and so forth, knowing well that only a few of the existing coins will establish themselves down the road. While the term crypto-coin is misleading in numerous ways and many of the coins are rather securities, a number of joint characteristics distinguish most of them from fiat currencies such as the US Dollar. Coin ecosystems are decentralized and distributed, i.e., there is no need for an institution such as the US Federal Reserve System, they are trustless in the sense that they do not require users to trust the participating parties,1 they are transparent and autonomous, i.e., they are governed by open source algorithms and changes that are not in line with the community can be suppressed or their effects mitigated by a fork, they offer some degree of anonymity, and they are immutable in the sense that information can be added but not (secretly) edited or removed. Academic publishing and (open) science more broadly are among the potential application areas for distributed ledger technologies and crypto-coins. Over 1As long as malicious actors do not control a substantial share of the nodes or processing power. the past months, this has led to numerous projects, most of them in a very early stage. The visions put forward in these proposals are often bold but also lacking in two critical ways: (1) they typically do not provide the level of detail required to understand their workings and value proposition, and (2) they seem to lack the combination of actors involved in academic publishing that would allow to test drive these visions in a realistic setup. Here we report on the outcomes of a meeting to explore the potential of distributed ledger technologies for academic publishing that took place in November 2017 in Santa Barbara, California, and brought three parties together: IOS Press as a publishing house, NEWGEN as a software engineering company familiar with journal management systems and academic workflows, as well as researchers from Wright State University and University of California, Santa Barbara, more precisely the editors-in-chief of the Semantic Web journal and some of their team members. Besides conceptualizing how a coin ecosystem may drive academic publishing in general and the Semantic Web journal in particular, the participants sought to understand and anticipate usability and scalability problems for users, i.e., scientists and the general public, but also other parties such as funding agencies and publishers. </p></div>

			                <p>We see at least the following areas where distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain could benefit science; see also [9]: </p><ol><li><p>Editing, reviewing and publishing academic work, e.g., by making the journal management workflows transparent. </p></li><li><p>Managing, i.e., storing and curating, scientific data to support the reproducibility of results and improve access to scientific data. </p></li><li><p>Connecting researchers to funding sources such as foundations or reversing the process entirely and allowing researchers to bid for existing proposals, e.g., social challenges. </p></li><li><p>Managing intellectual property, establishing identity, and preventing fraud. </p></li><li><p>Democratizing science by making various decisions on the level of funding agencies, journal editorial boards, conference organizers, award and career committees, etc., more transparent and by enabling the research community to vote on important decisions </p></li><li><p>Opening up the black-boxes resulting from algorithms and closed data sources such as impact factors, citation counts, and so on. </p></li></ol><p>In the following, we will outline use cases for each of these application areas and point out which characteristics of distributed ledger technologies they require. </p><p><strong>(1) </strong>Open access refers to making research outputs, mainly publications and the utilized data, freely and publicly accessible, often under a Creative Commons license to foster reuse. However, the peer review process as such can also be opened, e.g., by making submissions available during the review process or publishing reviews online as well. In this case, it makes sense to distinguish between openness and transparency. We call a review process open if the submissions and reviews are publicly available and transparent when the entire workflow, i.e., the assignment of editors and reviewers, the decisions taken, potential revisions, author responses, and so forth, are made available as well [10]. The Semantic Web journal follows such a setup and shares all data as Linked Data.2 Besides making the review process more transparent, this new wealth of data also enables linked scientometrics [11] and more advanced search capabilities for articles, authors, reviewers, and journals by combining vector embeddings computed from the full-text submissions and knowledge graphs generated from the journal management workflow [12]. As long as this setup would be restricted to the Semantic Web journal (or at least the same and trustworthy academic publisher), one would not need distributed ledger technologies as no decentralization is present, the setup is mostly transparent by design, and there is no reason to distrust the involved parties (or, at least, their identity is known). However, all this changes rapidly, when multiple journals and conferences organized by various actors are involved. In such a case, it is unlikely and even undesirable for a few parties to act as central data storage, identity management gateways, and maintainers of services. Hence, such a setup would indeed benefit from distributed ledger technologies [13]. Moreover, these technologies and ledgers could take on some important additional tasks such as managing timestamps, voting on issues that affect the entire ecosystem such as publication fees, and so on. Finally, 2All IOS Press bibliographic data is available as Linked Data at LD Connect. For instance, the SWJ data can be accessed at http: //ld.iospress.nl/ios/sw. they could provide a technical solution around incentivization, e.g., by assigning coin rewards to tasks such as editing or reviewing; see also [14, 15]. Put differently, so-called smart contracts could be used to model the agreement between a journal and a reviewer to submit the review by an agreed deadline. </p><p><strong>(2) </strong>Reproducibility of scientific experiments and reusability of data are major themes in academia but also for the broader public and its credibility crisis. One can envision how all scientific data, scientific procedures and software used for sampling, data preparation, visualization, and so forth [16â€“20] could be shared on a distributed and immutable file system such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Similarly, all uses of data, e.g., publications, could be automatically linked to the datasets to generate provenance records. In contrast to todayâ€™s situation where research teams are often in exclusive control of their data, storing them on a ledger would make all edits permanently visible [21, 22]. Hence, everybody could track what data were used for a scientific publication and whether they have been altered in some way. Most of the currently existing blockchains would not be suitable for such an approach as adding data to them is a slow and very expensive process. However, projects such as Multichain could address these issues and also provide support for private chains. In general, Linked Data and ontologies that have been developed to model scientific workflows, observation data, and provenance records would be well-suited to describe the data to be stored on the chain. </p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Similar to the examples above, distributed ledger technologies can also be used to handle calls, submissions, reviewing, voting, etc., for research funding. We can envision at least three ways in which this would work. The first case is analogous to the academic publishing use case outlined above but would handle the submission, review, and selection of research proposals. Fairness, in general, seems to be an important issue as the competition for funds is increasing, while researchers that compete for the same resources are reviewing each othersâ€™ proposals. Second, researchers could vote for or suggest research directions more easily and based on a wider community engagement. Third, one could reverse the funding process and instead of researchers submitting their proposals to a funding agency, interested parties could put forward challenges and rewards for addressing them. Similarly, researchers could put their portfolios online for donors to chose from.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> With a rapidly growing scientific community and competition, managing the identity of researchers, institutions, funding agencies, publishers, etc., becomes a more pressing issue, e.g., to reduce predatory publishing and other practices. These services could also assist in co-reference resolution, thereby improving information retrieval, knowledge graphs, and so on. Finally, they could also assist in other tasks that relate to trust such as repeated submissions and questions relating to prior work, e.g., whether somebody used ideas and methods from a proposal s/he was asked to review.</p><p><strong>(5)</strong> Voting has been mentioned in the use cases before because it is a key application area of distributed ledger technologies. In general, these technologies could help to flatten the hierarchies that still dominate the scientific community and enable a broader base to form to arrive at decisions about tenure, the publishing culture, and so forth. </p><p><strong>(6)</strong> As in so many other areas of everyday life, decisions taken in science rely increasingly on closed data and algorithms. The results returned by these systems can have dramatic consequences for the individual, yet most of these systems are black boxes. The examples above mostly relate to the data storage capability of blockchains, while this use case would also benefit from the (source) â€˜code is lawâ€™ culture of crypto ecosystems. Typically, these ecosystems are entirely driven by consensus and open source. For instance, smart contracts are protocols that define and enforce the execution of a (legal) contract, e.g., to handle transactions, without the need for a third party. The code of these smart contracts is public. Using distributed ledger technologies, both the data and the algorithms would be openly available, thereby making the results of measures such as a journalâ€™s impact factors or an authorâ€™s h-index reproducible. </p></div>

			                <p>Many of the use cases outlined above have a strong social component. After all, distributed ledger technologies were developed to function in a trustless and decentralized environment. Nonetheless, one has to be careful if trying to apply these technologies to solve social problems. For instance, before deciding to make measures such as the h-index reproducible by computing it based on open citation data, we should ask ourselves whether we want research to be governed by such measures in the first place. Similarly, before essentially turning the acquisition of research funding into a bounty hunt, we have to understand the implications, e.g., with respect to the Matthew effect. 3 Will voting and bounty-based models lead to an even more unbalanced distribution of funding based on the popularity and marketability of a topic? Along the same lines, if we distrust our colleagues and workflows, is technology the right answer?

                </sup></span>. Other characteristics of distributed ledger technologies may have problematic side effects as well. For instance, we discussed the immutability of the InterPlanetary File System and blockchains in general as an advantage above, but one can also take a different perspective. As editors-in-chief of the Semantic Web journal, we are frequently asked by authors to depublish rejected manuscripts and we have a policy for doing so: papers can be depublished after a minimum of 4 weeks after the decision letter has been announced. The need for such a compromise highlights why strict immutability is problematic. Many journals and conferences have fixed rules about publishing overlapping work and their systems will search the Web for existing similar publications or plagiarism. In the early days of the Semantic Web journal, we frequently had to explain to editors of other outlets that a paper available on our webpage has not been published and can safely be resubmitted to another journal. We also had numerous other cases that required the ability to change records permanently, e.g., where authors asked to resubmit a paper (before reviewers had been assigned) because they forgot to remove a potentially embarrassing comment from the submission. Similarly, we assume that most conference organizers are familiar with reviewers accidentally submitting a review for another paper or putting the confidential part of a review into the textbox that will become visible to authors. Next, there are cases where authors need to submit their work without identifying themselves such as William Sealy Gosset having to publish his famous tdistribution under the pseudonym Student. While permanent identifiers such as ORCID make this increasingly difficult, distributed ledger technologies have a potential to do both [23]: either make anonymity almost impossible by linking all scientific activities to profiles/addresses, or enable strong anonymity â€“ a feature promoted by some crypto-currency ecosystems.</p><p><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]">(Walpor, 2016)</span><span class="citation" data-format="autocite" data-references="[{&quot;id&quot;:523876277}]">(Angraal, , Krumholz, &amp; Schulz, 2017)</span></p></div>
