<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#Backgroundandrelatedwork> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p> Nowadays, MCBS have become a part of our daily life. They can be found in cities, commercial centers, supermarkets, offices, and even in houses. The advances in image sensor technology allow us to have SCs, which are low-cost and low-power systems that capture high-level description of a scene R. Marroquin et al. / Ontology for a Panoptes building 3 and analyze it in real-time [58]. These SCs can extract necessary/pertinent information from different images/video by employing different image processing algorithms such as face detection [55], person detection [10], people tracking [18], fall detection [44], object detection [15], etc. Smart camera networks have been used in the built environment for a long time. The main applications focus on the following problematics: \u2013 Study of space-use: space-use is a research that aims at analyzing the relation between built spaces and their use. An example of this research was presented by Tom\u00E9 et al. which established correlations between the occupancy/movement patterns and the space properties by using computer vision and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in a university environment [52]. \u2013 Monitoring of elderly people: this application focus on health care and ambient assisted living. Some notable works in this field are: Nawaz et al. which used SCs to monitor the activities of elderly people while protecting their privacy [34]; and Crispim-Junior et al. which developed a multi-camera based framework to recognize the activities of elderly people during a clinical protocol in a hospital [25]. \u2013 Security, monitoring and surveillance: these are the most well-known applications in the built environment; they consists in using the visual information to monitor the activities of the building users. Yu et al. developed a robust image processing algorithm to perform multi-camera multiobject tracking in a built environment [59]; other examples in this field can be found in the survey of Winkler et al. [57]. Most of the previous applications use a SCN deployed in a built environment to obtain and analyze different types of information. Therefore, they might be considered as Panoptes building applications. The main function of a Panoptes building is to combine the different information obtained by the SCN and to deduce the triggering of actions/events in real-time. In this context, a Panoptes building application should understand the static building information as well as perceive (accurately) the dynamic and evolving data, i.e., it should be aware of its context. The creation of a context-aware system in the built environment is a complex task; it requires information from different domains such as environment data, sensing devices, spatio-temporal facts and details about the different events that may occur. For example, the required event information could be a set of concepts and relations concerning the different events that may occur in a built environment, their location, the time they occurred, the agents involved, the relation to other events and their consequences. In the case of the sensor information, the required data could be the description of the different sensing devices, the processes implemented on them and their results. Regarding the environment, the required data could be the building topology and the different elements contained in the spaces. The built environment data can be obtained using the Building Information Modeling (BIM) of a building. BIM becomes a general term designing the set of numerical data, objects and processes appended during the life-cycle of a building [14]. From the design, construction and facility management steps, the BIM allows practitioners and managers to exchange data in a uniform way using the IFC standard [54]. The IFC gives the base of description of all elements making the building, both semantic and graphic [24]. This allows to aggregate all heterogeneous software dedicated to the built environment in an interoperable manner. In the domain of interoperability three levels are described: technical, organizational and semantics [23]. The IFC aims the technical interoperability level [11]. The organizational level is in charge of the practitioners according to the law of each country and the rules of each enterprise. The semantics level aims to clearly specify the meaning of each element making the BIM. An important work was made to bring the IFC EXPRESS schema into the semantic web world using OWL as the schema modeling language [39]. The result is the ifcowl ontology whose main objective is to convert the IFC concepts and instances data into equivalent RDF data. The conversion procedure from EXPRESS to OWL can be found in [39,40]. According to Studer, an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization [47]. In other words, an ontology is a set of concepts and relations used to describe and represent an area of concern. Currently, the most common language for representing ontologies is OWL-2, which is the recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [56]. Other recommended technologies/languages in the semantic web domain are: RDF, used for representing information in the form of a graph composed of triples 4 R. Marroquin et al. / Ontology for a Panoptes building [9]; RDF Schema (RDFS), which provides a vocabulary for creating a hierarchy of classes and properties [3]; SPARQL1 , used to query RDF data [51]; and the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL2 ), which is used for extending the OWL model with rule axioms [22]. One important application of ontology is semantic fusion, which consists in integrating and organizing data and knowledge coming from multiple heterogeneous sources and to unify them into a consistent representation. Some important works in this domain are: \u2013 Hong et al. presented some context-aware systems where the ontology plays a central role for enabling interoperability between devices and agents which are not designed to work together [20]. \u2013 Dibley et al. developed an ontology framework that combines a sensor ontology with a building ontology and other supporting ontologies [12]. \u2013 SanMiguel et al. used an ontology for combining image processing algorithms with knowledge about objects and events [43]. \u2013 Chaochaisit et al. presented a semantic connection between sensor specification, localization methods and contextual information [6]. \u2013 Town presented an ontology that fuses multiple computer vision stages with context information for image retrieval and event detections [53]. \u2013 Suchan and Bhatt developed a framework to reasoning about human activities using commonsense knowledge founded in qualitative spatiotemporal relations and human-object interactions [48]. Based on the state of the art, the information extracted by a SCN could be converted to semantic data. Moreover, a specially designed ontology would enable to deal and merge multi-sources of heterogeneous data (i.e., from different cameras, other types of sensors, a priori data from the environment). Hence, we propose the creation of a semantic based system which is a context-aware system that uses an ontology to combine the information extracted by a SCN with logic rules and knowledge of what the camera observes, building information and events that may occur.</p><figure data-caption=\"\" data-equation=\"\" data-figure-category=\"figure\" data-image=\"22\" data-image-src=\"/media/images/a41e28cc-0a74-4057-a1bb-b8290a8a9998.jpg\" id=\"F81714721\"><div><img src=\"a41e28cc-0a74-4057-a1bb-b8290a8a9998.jpg\"/></div><figcaption><span class=\"figure-cat-figure\" data-figure-category=\"figure\">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]\">(Baader, Calvanese, &amp; McGuinness, 2003)</span><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:3785067640}]\">(Bay, Ess, Tuytelaars, &amp; Van Gool, 2007)</span></p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

It was impossible to deceive his vigilance, for only some of his eyes slept while the rest were awake [36]. Argus was the servant of Hera. At his death, Hera rewarded the giant\u2019s fidelity by placing his eyes on the feathers of the peacock, her sacred animal. &quot;To have the eyes of Argus&quot; is a popular expression which means to be lucid and vigilant. The term Panoptes means &quot;all-seeing&quot;, which within the built environment is a quest in terms of access control, flow control and activity control. In that context, a Panoptes building would characterize a smart building *Corresponding author.

In classical multi-camera based systems (MCBS) there is a monitor room with a central processing server where all the information is collected and analyzed in real-time by one or more human operators. However, as the size of the network increases, it becomes more difficult (or even impossible) for the human operators to monitor all the video streams at the same time and to identify events. Furthermore, having a large amount of information makes it infeasible to create a relation between past and current actions. Based on our experience, some issues and limitations of MCBS deployed in built environments have been identified, such as: 1570-0844/0-1900/$35.00 \u00A9 0 \u2013 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 R. Marroquin et al. / Ontology for a Panoptes building \u2013 Selecting and filtering relevant information from the large amount of generated data. \u2013 Dealing with missing information and non-detectable information. For example, a person may become not-visible to a camera due to their position or an obstruction. \u2013 Reconfiguration of the cameras according to their context. The camera should adjust its configuration to ease the task of identifying a specific object or action. For example, the cameras should be able to adjust their parameters (e.g., aperture and shutter speed) according to the light in the environment. \u2013 Integration of data from different nodes and different domains. A MCBS should be able to link the contextual information with the information coming from the different camera nodes to identify events and take decisions. \u2013 Privacy protection. There are many privacy laws that restrict the monitoring of people, therefore, a MCBS should be able to extract the useful information from an image/video while protecting the privacy of the individuals. Many efforts have been devoted to deal with the aforesaid limitations of the MCBS. The most prominent one is to rely on smart cameras (SCs) to perform visual tasks semi-autonomously (with minimal human interaction). Smart cameras are specialized cameras that contain not only the image sensor but also a processing unit and some communication interfaces. In a few words, SCs are self-contained vision systems [32,58]. The use of SCs in the built environment has become a growing trend due to the rich contextual data provided. In the built environment, context is an essential factor since it provides information about the current status of users, places, objects, sensors and events. We assume that a smart building is a context-aware system because it extracts, interprets and uses the contextual information to automatically adapt its functionality according to the contextual changes. A Panoptes building is a type of smart building that uses only SC sensors and its main task is to monitor the different activities that occur in the built environment; in contrast to the smart building which uses different types of sensors and which mainly focuses on managing/monitoring the energy consumption. The creation of a Panoptes building is a complicated task due to the integration of data coming from different domains around the knowledge of the building. Many works have been done using semantic web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent contextual data [20]. On those systems, the ontology plays a crucial role in enabling the processing and sharing of information and knowledge, i.e., the use of an ontology allows interoperability between different domains. This paper presents an ontology for a Panoptes building that re-purposes and integrates information from different domains composing the built context. The proposed ontology is the kernel of the WiseNET (Wise NETwork) system, which is a context-aware system whose main function is to perform reasoning about heterogeneous sources of information [30]. Explicitly, the WiseNET system enhances the information of a smart camera network (SCN) with contextual information to allow autonomously real-time event/anomalies detection and system reconfiguration. The main contribution of this paper is the semanticsbased system, which allow us to overcome the MCBS limitations and some computer vision problems, especially the privacy protection which nowadays is an important factor to consider. This is achieved by the semantic fusion of Industry Foundations Classes (IFC) data with sensor information and other domain information in the Panoptes context. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the terminology used in the paper as well as summarizes related works. Section 3 gives an overview of the WiseNET system. Section 4 describes the development process of the WiseNET ontology and its links to existing ontologies. Section 5 presents the ontology population from the IFC data. Section 6 presents the ontology population from the SCs which consists of a static population, performed during the system configuration, and a dynamic population which is performed each time the SCs detect a person. Sections 7 presents some evaluations and use cases and finally, Section 8 presents the conclusions and prospectives. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
