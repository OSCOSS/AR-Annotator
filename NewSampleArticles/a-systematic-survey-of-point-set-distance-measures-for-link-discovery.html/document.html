While discovering links between resources on the Web of Data has been shown to be a demanding task, discovering links between geo-spatial resources proves to be even more challenging. This is partly due to the resources being described by the means of vector geometry. Especially, discrepancies in granularity and error measurements across data sets render the selection of appropriate distance measures for geo-spatial resources difficult. In this paper, we survey existing literature for point-set measures that can be used to measure the similarity of vector geometries. We then present and evaluate the ten measures that we derived from literature. We evaluate these measures with respect to their time-efficiency and their robustness against discrepancies in measurement and in granularity. To this end, we use samples of real data sets of different granularity as input for our evaluation framework. The results obtained on three different data sets suggest that most distance approaches can be led to scale. Moreover, while some distance measures are significantly slower than other measures, distance measure based on means, surjections and sums of minimal distances are robust against the different types of discrepancies.</p></section></p><div class="article-part metadata article-keywords"><span class="keyword">Link discovery</span><span class="keyword"> Geographic Distances</span></div><div class="article-part article-body"><section id="1.Introduction" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#1.Introduction">

			                <p>The Web of Data has grown significantly over the last years. In particular, very large data sets pertaining to different domains such as bio-medicine (e.g., LinkedTCGA with now 20+ billion triples [40]) and geo-locations (e.g., LinkedGeoData with approximately 30 billion triples [4]) have been made available. Implementing the fourth Linked Data principle (i.e., the creation of links between these knowledge bases and other knowledge bases) for 2 Sherif and Ngonga Ngomo / A Systematic Survey of Point Set Distance Measures for Link Discovery \Fig. 1. Vector description of the country of Malta. The blue polygons shows the vector geometry for Malta in the NUTS data set, the red polygon shows the same for the DBpedia, while the black point shows the location of the same real-world entity according to LinkedGeoData. geometry. Thus, devising means for using geo-spatial information to improve link discovery requires providing means to measure distances between such vector geometry data. Examples of vector geometry descriptions for the country of Malta are shown in Figure 1. As displayed in the examples, two types of discrepancies occur when one compares the vector descriptions of the same real-world entity (e.g., Malta) in different data sets: First, the different vector descriptions of a given real-world entity often comprise different points across different data sets. For example, Malta’s vector description in DBpedia contains the point with latitude 14.46 and longitude 35.89. In LinkedGeoData, the same country is described by the point of latitude 14.5 and longitude 35.9. We dub the discrepancy in latitude and longitude for points in the vector description measurement discrepancy. A second type of discrepancy that occurs in the vector description of geospatial resources across different data sets are discrepancies in granularity. For example, Malta is described by one polygon in DBpedia, two polygons in NUTS and a single point in LinkedGeoData. Analysing the behaviour of different measures with respect to these two types of discrepancies is of central importance to detect the measures that should be used for geo-spatial link discovery. In this paper, we address this research gap by first surveying existing measures that can be used for comparing point sets. We then compare these measures in series of experiments on samples extracted from three real data sets with the aim of answering the questions introduced in Section 3. Note that throughout the paper, we model complex representations of geo-spatial objects as point sets. While more complex representations can be chosen, comparing all corresponding measures would go beyond the scope of this paper. In addition, we are only concerned with atomic measures and do not consider combinations of measures. Approaches that allow combining measures can be found in [29]. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces some basic assumption and notations that will be used all over the rest of the paper. Section 3 introduces our systematic survey methodology. Then, in Section 4 we give a detailed description of each of point set distance functions, as well as their mathematical formulation and different implementations. Thereafter, in Section 5 we introduce evaluation of our work for both scalability and robustness. Finally, we conclude the paper with a brief overview of related work (Section 6), as well as a conclusion and future work (Section 7).

			                <p>We assume the link discovery (LD) problem as being formulated in a way akin to [31]: Given two sets S and T of resources as well as a predicate p, compute the set M = {(s, t) ∈ S × T :&lt; s, p, t &gt; holds}, where &lt; s, p, t &gt; is the RDF triple with the subject s, the predicate p and the object t. Computing M directly is commonly a non-trivial task. State-of-the-art link discovery systems thus most commonly aim to compute an approximation M0 of M with M0 = {(s, t) : δ(s, t) ≤ θ}, where δ is a complex distance function and θ is a distance threshold. δ most commonly consists of a combination of atomic measures which can be used to compare property values of the resources s and t. For example, the edit distance is an atomic measure that can be used to compare the labels of two resources. In addition to bearing properties similar to those bared by other types of resources (label, country, etc.), geo-spatial resources are commonly described by means of vector geometry.2 Each vector descrip1http://limes.sf.net 2Most commonly encoded in the WKT format, see http:// www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa. Sherif and Ngonga Ngomo / A Systematic Survey of Point Set Distance Measures for Link Discovery 3 tion can be modelled as a set of points. We will write can be computed based on the great elliptic curve distance [10]. Note that this distance is recommended in previous works (e.g., [13]) as it is more accurate than the orthodromic distance. However, given that our evaluations (see Table 2) showed that the distance error of orthodromic distance did not affect the LD results and that the orthodromic distance has a lower time complexity that the great elliptic curve distance, we rely on the orthodromic distance throughout the explanations in this paper. Computing the distance between sets of points is yet a more difficult endeavor. Over the last years, several measures have been developed to achieve this task. Most of these approaches regard vector descriptions as ordered set of points. In the following sections, we present such measures and evaluate their robustness against different types of discrepancies. </p></div>
