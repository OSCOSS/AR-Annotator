<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html> <http://schema.org/abstract> "<p>The Web of Data, and in particular Linked Data, has seen tremendous growth over the past years. However, reuse and take-up of these rich data sources is often limited and focused on a few well-known and established RDF datasets. This can be partially attributed to the lack of reliable and up-to-date information about the characteristics of available datasets. While RDF datasets vary heavily with respect to the features related to quality, provenance, interlinking, licenses, statistics and dynamics, reliable information about such features is essential to enable dataset discovery and selection in tasks such as entity linking, distributed query, search or question answering. Even though there exists a wealth of works contributing to the task of dataset profiling in general, these works are spread across a wide range of communities. In this survey, we provide a first comprehensive overview of the RDF dataset profiling features, methods, tools and vocabularies. We organize these building blocks of dataset profiling in a taxonomy and illustrate the links between the dataset profiling and feature extraction approaches and several application domains. This survey is aimed towards data practitioners, data providers and scientists, spanning a large range of communities and drawing from different fields such as dataset profiling, assessment, summarization and characterization. Ultimately, this work is intended to facilitate the reader to identify the relevant features for building a dataset profile for intended applications together with the methods and tools capable of extracting these features from the datasets as well as vocabularies to describe the extracted features and make them available.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1.Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The Web of Data, and in particular Linked Data [8], has seen tremendous growth over the past number of years, leading up to the availability of a large *Corresponding author. amount of RDF datasets1 on the Web, where a recent crawl2 of linked datasets retrieved over 1000 datasets alone, including over 8 million explicit resources and an estimated 100 billion triples. RDF datasets and their 1For readability, we use the terms \u201CRDF dataset\u201D and \u201Cdataset\u201D interchangeably within this survey. 2http://linkeddatacatalog.dws.informatik. uni-mannheim.de/state 1570-0844/0-1900/$27.50 c 0 \u2013 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved 2 Ben Ellefi et al. / RDF Dataset Profiling - a Survey of Features, Methods, Vocabularies and Applications inherent subgraphs vary heavily with respect to their size, topic and domain coverage, resource types and schemas as well as their dynamics and currency. Given this scale, the discovery of suitable RDF datasets, which satisfy specific criteria, has become a challenging problem for a variety of applications including entity linking, entity retrieval, distributed search, query federation, and question answering, just to name a few. This prevalent problem is underlined by the strong bias towards using established and wellknown reference knowledge graphs such as DBpedia [3], YAGO [71] or Wikidata3 , although there exists a long tail of potentially suitable domain-specific yet under-recognized datasets. In the context of this survey, an RDF dataset is defined in accordance with the dataset definition in the Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)4 , namely: \u201CA Dataset is a set of RDF triples that are published, maintained or aggregated by a single provider\u201D5 . According to VoID, a dataset represents a meaningful collection of triples as envisioned by its provider. An RDF Dataset Profile is a formal representation of a set of dataset characteristics (features). It describes the dataset and aids dataset discovery, recommendation and comparison with regard to the represented features. A Dataset Profile Feature is a characteristic describing a certain attribute of the dataset. For instance, \u201Cdataset conciseness\u201D is a dataset profile feature providing information on the degree of redundancy of the information contained in the dataset. A dataset profile is extensible with respect to the features it contains. Usually, the relevant feature set is application-oriented and depends on the envisaged application scenarios. A number of popular dataset registries have emerged, which tackle the problem of dataset discovery through the curation of lightweight dataset descriptions, often also exposing structured metadata according to the state-of-the-art vocabularies such as DCAT6 or VoID. Popular examples include DataHub7 or DataCite8 , while the LinkedUp Catalog9 (for education) represents a domain-specific example. However, while such metadata is usually edited and curated manually, 3https://www.wikidata.org 4http://vocab.deri.ie/void 5http://www.w3.org/TR/void/#dataset 6http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/ 7http://www.datahub.io 8https://www.datacite.org/ 9http://data.linkededucation.org/linkedup/ catalog/ it is often sparse, not in sync with the constant evolution of the actual datasets, and prone to errors. On the one hand, as the Web of Data as a whole is evolving along with the constant evolution of individual datasets, manual assessment and representation of a large variety of dataset features is neither feasible nor sustainable. On the other hand, a wide variety of competing as well as complementary approaches exist, aimed at automatic assessment and description of arbitrary datasets. This body of work is spanning several research communities and includes works in fields such as dataset characterisation, data summarisation, dataset assessment or dataset profiling. While the problem of dataset profiling is of particular importance in the context of the Web of Data, it has been identified and approached already in other related fields, such as general database and data management research. Emerging from the aforementioned works, a wealth of tools, methods, vocabularies and applications for assessing, describing and profiling datasets has become available throughout the past few years, where a comprehensive overview and classification is still missing. Myriads of terms and notions do co-exist, whereas a clear distinction, classification and comparison is still required. Only recently, some first efforts have been made to bring together such disparate yet closely related fields, e.g. in [21]. The aim of this survey is to provide researchers, dataset providers and application developers with an overview of dataset profiling and closely related approaches, including dataset profile features, feature extraction methods and tools, vocabularies, and example applications to encourage experimentation and facilitate the broader use of RDF datasets. Being the first comprehensive study in this area, we provide a thorough analysis and definition of related terms and typical dataset profile features. Furthermore, we provide a systematic study of the available methods and tools for assessing and profiling structured datasets, and survey state-of-the-art vocabularies for representing dataset profiles. While some of the discussed works are dedicated to profiling RDF datasets in particular, works of relevance from other related fields are also discussed. In this survey we address domain-agnostic dataset profiling approaches (e.g., the Linked Data Observatory [26]) as described in Section 4, and RDF-based vocabularies for representing resource metadata, such as general metadata, quality, provenance, links, licensing, statistics and dynamics, which are applicable to datasets as a particular kind of resource on the Web as Ben Ellefi et al. / RDF Dataset Profiling - a Survey of Features, Methods, Vocabularies and Applications 3 described in Section 5. It should be noted that domainspecific vocabularies (e.g., Medical Subject Headings (MESH)10 or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED)11) are out of the scope of this survey, even though they can be useful in formalizing domainspecific aspects of a dataset description. In summary, in this survey we provide the following contributions: </p><ul><li><p>A taxonomy of dataset profile features, including \u201Cgeneral\u201D, \u201Cqualitative\u201D, \u201Cprovenance\u201D, \u201Clinks\u201D, \u201Clicensing\u201D, \u201Cstatistical\u201D and \u201Cdynamics\u201D feature categories; </p></li><li><p>A systematic overview of dataset profile feature extraction approaches and tools and their discussion in the context of the taxonomy;</p></li><li><p>An overview and a classification of available vocabularies for representing dataset features and profiles according to the taxonomy; </p></li><li><p>An illustration of the use of dataset profiles in several application scenarios. </p></li></ul><p>The remainder of the survey is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the methodology adopted to collect and organise the publications included in this survey. Next, we provide a comprehensive set of commonly investigated dataset features (Section 3), based on the existing literature and organize these features into a taxonomy. Then, we provide an overview of the existing approaches and tools for the automatic extraction of dataset profile features (Section 4), followed by an overview of existing RDF vocabularies for the representation of certain dataset profiles and features (Section 5). Where feasible, we also provide suggestions on vocabulary use and offer vocabulary recommendations suitable for representing particular dataset profile features. We conclude by exemplifying subsets of features considered relevant in selected application scenarios in Section 6, and have a final discussion in Section 7. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#2.SurveyProcedure> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>In this section, we present the methodology adopted to select the publications discussed in this survey. The stages of the survey process are depicted in Fig. 1 and described in the following. 10https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh 11http://www.snomed.org </p><p>2.1. Terminology, Taxonomy and Search Process </p><p>As a starting point, we identified a basic terminology of dataset profile features, from which we extracted keywords that were potentially relevant for the scope of this survey, such as profiling, dynamicity, quality, index, etc. These keywords were defined and embedded into a taxonomy, which guided the overall study. The taxonomy was iteratively refined throughout the process. During the review process, we updated the taxonomy and consequently further modified the keywords by both including or excluding relevant features. The extracted keywords from the taxonomy were used individually and in combination to query several online databases and search engines (Fig. 1). For example, we used keywords and multiword expressions to build the following combinations: {Semantic Web, Linked Data, Linked Open Data (LOD), ...} \u00D7 {profiling, dynamicity, quality, index, ...}. </p><p>2.2. Literature Review </p><p>Each category of the resulting taxonomy covers a range of works in the Semantic Web and related fields and would potentially deserve a dedicated survey. In this survey, we provide a pivotal guide for readers to obtain a global view on the various dataset profile features illustrated by examples. For this purpose, we focused our review on key approaches established in each category of the taxonomy, while providing examples for: (i) The identification of the feature extraction methods and tools (Section 4); (ii) The identification of vocabularies for dataset profile representation (Section 5); and (iii) The illustration of some application-driven profiles (Section 6). </p><p>2.3. Overview of Selected Publications </p><p>By applying the selection and review procedure described in Section 2.1, we obtained a list of 85 publications ranging from 1993 to 2017 with about 78% of publications originating from [2009 \u2212 2016] as depicted in Fig. 2 and 7 W3C recommendations.
