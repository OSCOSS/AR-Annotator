The field has a good understanding of the biological parallels that can be drawn, the use of communication in multi-robot teams, and the design of architectures for multi-robot control. Considerable progress has been made in multi-robot localization/mapping/exploration, cooperative object transport, and motion coordination.  Recent progress is beginning to advance the areas of reconfigurable robotics and multi-robot learning. Of course, all of these areas have not yet been fully studied. Several other research challenges still remain, including:</p><ul><li><p>How do we identify and quantify the fundamental advantages and characteristics of multi-robot systems?</p></li><li><p>How do we easily enable humans to control multi-robot teams?</p></li><li><p>Can we scale up to demonstrations involving more than a dozen or so robots?</p></li><li><p>Is passive action recognition in multi-robot teams possible?</p></li><li><p>How can we enable physical multi-robot systems to work under hard real-time constraints?</p></li><li><p>How does the complexity of the task and of the environment affect the design of multi-robot systems?</p><p>These  and  other  issues  in  multi-robot  cooperation  should keep the research community busy for many years to come.</p></li></ul><p><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:0}]\">(Alami, Fleury, Herrb, Ingrand, &amp; Robert, 1997)</span><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:3737814426}]\">(Arkin, 1990)</span><span class=\"citation\" data-format=\"autocite\" data-references=\"[{&quot;id&quot;:1785132119}]\">(Arai, Ogata, &amp; Suzuki, 1989)</span></p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#II.BIOLOGICALINSPIRATIONS> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>Nearly all of the work in cooperative mobile robotics began after the introduction of the new robotics paradigm of behavior-based control [20], [3].  This behavior-based paradigm has had a strong influence in much of the cooperative mobile robotics research.    Because  the  behavior-based  paradigm  for  mobile robotics is rooted in biological inspirations, many cooperative robotics researchers have also found it instructive to examine the social characteristics of insects and animals, and to apply these findings to the design of multi-robot systems.</p><p>The most common application of this  knowledge is  in  the use of the simple local control rules of various biological societies \u2013 particularly ants, bees, and birds \u2013 to the development of  similar  behaviors  in  cooperative  robot  systems.   Work  in this vein has demonstrated the ability for multi-robot teams to flock, disperse, aggregate, forage, and follow trails (e.g., [44], [26], [28]). The application of the dynamics of ecosystems has also been applied to the development of multi-robot teams that demonstrate emergent cooperation as a result of acting on selfish interests [46].   To some extent, cooperation in higher animals, such as wolf packs, has generated advances in cooperative control.   Significant study in  predator-prey systems has occurred, although primarily in simulation [17], [34].  <span class=\"comment ref do\" data-id=\"3912330110\" rel=\"schema:hasPart\" resource=\"r-3912330110\" typeof=\"dctypes:Text\"><mark id=\"3912330110\" property=\"schema:description\">\n                        An exception is the article in this special issue, entitled \u201CMulti-Agent Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games with Unmanned Ground and Aerial Vehicles\u201D, by Vidal, Shakernia, Kim, Shim, and Sastry, which implements a pursuit-evasion task on a physical team of aerial and ground vehicles.\n                    </mark><sup class=\"ref-annotation\">\n    		        <a href=\"#3912330110\" rel=\"cito:hasReplyFrom\" resource=\"http://localhost:8000/document/2//comment-3912330110\">\n       		              \U0001F4AC\n                    </a>\n                </sup></span>   They evaluate various pursuit policies relaing expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilties of the pursuers.</p><figure data-caption=\"\" data-equation=\"\" data-figure-category=\"figure\" data-image=\"20\" data-image-src=\"/media/images/3a00f615-a97b-4201-b0b9-57d9efc6aa18.png\" id=\"F54744631\"><div><img src=\"3a00f615-a97b-4201-b0b9-57d9efc6aa18.png\"/></div><figcaption><span class=\"figure-cat-figure\" data-figure-category=\"figure\">figure 1: </span></figcaption></figure><p>Competition in  multi-robot systems,  such as  that  found in higher animals including humans, is being studied in domains such as multi-robot soccer.  A previous special journal issue in Artificial Intelligence on RoboCup discusses many of the advances in this area; see [6] for a general overview of the field, and [49], [7], [61], [64], [5] for some particular examples of this  research.   Another series  of books appears yearly in  the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series on the topic of multi-robot soccer,  beginning with [38].   Two articles in this special  issue  address  multi-robot control issues  in  the  multi-robot soccer domain.  These articles are \u201CCooperative Probabilistic State Estimation for Vision-based Autonomous Mobile Robots\u201D, by Schmitt, Hanek, Beetz, Buck, and Radig, and \u201CCS Freiburg: Coordinating Robots for Successful Soccer Playing\u201D, by Weigel, Gutmann, Dietl, Kleiner, and Nebel.</p><p>Many areas of biological inspiration and their applicability to multi-robot teams seem to be fairly well understood.  More recently identified,  less  well  understood,  biological topics  of relevance include the use of imitation in higher animals to learn new behaviors, and the physical interconnectivity demonstrated by  insects  such  as  ants  to  enable  collective  navigation  over challenging  terrains.   One  advance  in  this  area  is  presented in  the  article  in  this  issue  entitled  \u201CHormone-Inspired Adaptive Communication and Distributed control for CONRO Self-Reconfigurable Robots\u201D, by Shen, Salemi, and Will.  This article examines both the physical interconnectivity of modular robots, as well as biological inspirations for how to maintain communication and collaboration in a distributed multi-robot network.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

More recent work has resulted in a number of actual physical robot systems that are able to reconfigure. The motivation of this work is to achieve function from shape, allowing individual modules, or robots, to connect and re-connect in various ways to generate a desired shape to serve a needed function. These systems have the theoretical capability of showing great robustness, versatility, and even self-repair.</p><p>Most  of  the  work  in  this  area  involves  identical  modules with interconnection mechanisms that allow either manual or automatic reconfiguration.   These systems have been demonstrated to form into various navigation configurations, including a rolling track motion [70], an earthworm or snake motion [70], [24], and a spider or hexapod motion [70], [24].  Some systems employ a cube-type arrangement, with modules able to connect in various ways to form matrices or lattices for specific functions [19], [71], [58], [65].  An important example of this research is the article in this special issue by Shen, Salemi, and  Will,  entitled  \u201CHormone-Inspired Adaptive  Communication and Distributed Control for CONRO Self-Reconfigurable Robots\u201D. This article presents a biologically inspired approach for adaptive communication in self-reconfigurable and dynamic networks,  as well  as  physical module reconfiguration for accomplishing global effects such as locomotion.  They demonstrate their results in the context of the CONRO modules that they have developed.</p><p>Research  in  this  area  is  still  very  young,  and  most  of  the systems developed are not yet able to perform beyond laboratory experiments. While the potential of large numbers of robot modules has been demonstrated in simulation, it is still uncommon to have implementations involving more than a dozen or so physical modules. The practical application of these systems is yet to be demonstrated, although progress is being made in that direction. Clearly, this is a rich area for continuing advances in multi-robot systems.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#III.COMMUNICATION> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>The issue of communication in multi-robot teams has been extensively studied since the inception of distributed robotics research. Distinctions between implicit and explicit communication are usually made, in which implicit communication occurs as a side-effect of other actions,  or \u201Cthrough the world\u201D (see,  for  example  [51]),  whereas  explicit  communication  is a specific  act designed solely to convey information to other robots on the team.   Several researchers have studied the effect of communication on the performance of multi-robot teams in a variety of tasks, and have concluded that communication provides certain benefit for particular types of tasks (e.g., [43], [16]). Additionally, these researchers have found that, in many cases, communication of even a small amount of information can lead to great benefit (e.g., [16]).</p><p>More recent work in multi-robot communication has focused on representations of languages and the grounding of these representations in the physical world [35], [36]. Additionally, work has extended to achieving fault tolerance in multi-robot communication, such as setting up and maintaining distributed communications  networks  [68]  and  ensuring  reliability  in  multi-robot  communications  [48].   An  important  related  aspect  of multi-robot communication has  been  addressed in  the  article by  Shen,  Salemi,  and  Will  in  this  issue,  entitled  \u201CHormone-Inspired Adaptive Communication and Distributed Control for CONRO Self-Reconfigurable Robots\u201D, which examines the use of adaptive communication in modular, reconfigurable robotics.</p><p>The challenge in these systems is to maintain communication even when connections between robots may change dynamically and unexpectedly. This article demonstrates one aspect of the recent progress that is being made in enabling multi-robot teams  to  operate reliably  event amidst  faulty communication environments.</p><p>Another article in this special issue,  entitled \u201CPerformance of  a  Distributed  Robotic  System  using  Shared  Communications  Channels\u201D,  by  Rybski,  Stoeter,  Gini,  Hougen,  and  Papanikolopoulos,  explores communications issues  of  teams  of miniature robots that must use very low capacity RF communications due to their small size. They approach this issue through the use of process scheduling to share the available communications resources.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#V.LOCALIZATION,MAPPING,ANDEXPLORATION> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>An extensive amount of research has been carried out in the area  of localization,  mapping,  and  exploration for  single  autonomous robots.  Only fairly recently has much of this work been applied to multi-robot teams.  Almost all of the work has been aimed at 2D environments. Initially, most of this research took an existing algorithm developed for single robot mapping, localization, or exploration, and extended it to multiple robots.</p><p>More recently, researchers have developed new algorithms that are  fundamentally distributed.   One  example  of  this  work  is given in [31], which takes advantage of multiple robots to improve positioning accuracy beyond what is possible with single robots.  Another example is an article in this special issue entitled \u201CDistributed Multi-Robot Localization\u201D, by Roumeliotis and Bekey.  This article presents a decentralized Kalman-filter based approach to enable a group of mobile robots to simultaneously localize by sensing their teammates and combining positioning information from all the team members. They illustrate the effectiveness of their approach through application on a team of three physical robots.</p><p>An additional article in this special issue examines vision-based localization in multi-robot teams.   This article, entitled \u201CCooperative Probabilistic State  Estimation for  Vision-Based Autonomous Mobile Robots\u201D, by Schmitt, Hanek, Beetz, Buck, and Radig, develops and analyzes a probabilistic, vision-based state  estimation  method  that  enables  robot team  members to estimate their joint positions in a known environment.  Their approach also enables robot team members to track positions of autonomously moving objects.  They illustrate their approach on physical robots in the multi-robot soccer domain.</p><p>As is the case with single robot approaches to localization, mapping, and exploration, research into the multi-robot version can be described using the familiar categories based on the use of landmarks [25], scan-matching [21], and/or graphs [56], and which use either range sensors (such as sonar or laser) or vision sensors. The article entitled \u201CLOST: Localization-Space Trails for Robot Teams\u201D, by Vaughan, Stoy, Sukhatme, and Mataric, presents  an  algorithm  enabling  a  robot  team  to  navigate  between places of interest in an initially unknown environment by using a trail of waypoint landmarks.  They illustrate that their approach copes with accumulating odometry error, is robust to the failure of individual robots, and converges to the best route</p><p>discovered by any robot on the team.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

Many research projects have dealt  with  this  topic  area;  fewer  of  these  projects  have been demonstrated on physical robot systems. This research area has a number of practical applications that make it of particular interest for study.</p><p>Numerous  variations  on  this  task  area  have  been  studied,  including  constrained  and  unconstrained  motions,  two-robot teams versus \u201Cswarm\u201D-type teams, compliant versus non-compliant grasping mechanisms,  cluttered  versus  uncluttered environments,  global  system  models  versus  distributed  models, and so forth.  Perhaps the most demonstrated task involving  cooperative transport is  the  pushing of  objects  by  multi-robot teams [57], [60].  This task seems inherently easier than the carry task, in which multiple robots must grip common objects and navigate to a destination in a coordinated fashion [67], [37].  A novel form of multi-robot transportation that has been demonstrated  is  the  use  of  ropes  wrapped  around  objects  to move them along desired trajectories [27].</p><p>An article in this special issue, entitled \u201CCooperative Transport by Multiple Mobile Robots in Unknown Static Environments Associated with Real-time Task-Assignment\u201D, by Miyata, Ota, Arai, and Asama, explores the cooperative transport task by multiple mobile robots in an unknown static environment.  Their approach enables robot team members to displace objects that are interfering with the transport task, and to cooperatively push objects to a destination.  They illustrate their results both in simulation and using a team of two physical robots.</p><p>The article by Das, Fierro, Kumar, Ostrowski, Spletzer, and Taylor,  entitled  \u201CA  Framework  for  Vision  Based  Formation Control\u201D, presents a novel approach for cooperative manipulation that is based on formation control. Their approach enables robot teams to cooperatively manipulate obstacles by trapping them inside the multi-robot formation. They demonstrate their results on a team of three physical robots.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#VII.MOTIONCOORDINATION> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>Another popular topic of study in multi-robot teams is that of motion coordination. Research themes in this domain that have been particularly well studied include multi-robot path planning [63], [41], [30], [69], traffic control [55], formation generation [2], and formation keeping [13], [66]. Most of these issues are now  fairly  well  understood,  although demonstration of  these techniques in physical multi-robot teams (rather than in simulation) has been limited.   More recent issues  studied within the motion coordination context are target tracking [53],  target search [39], and multi-robot docking [47] behaviors.  The motion coordination problem in the form of path planning for multiple robots is addressed in this special issue by Saptharishi, Oliver, Diehl, Bhat, Dolan, Trebi-Ollennu, and Khosla in the article  entitled  \u201CDistributed Surveillance and  Reconnaissance Using Multiple Autonomous ATVs:  CyberScout\u201D.  In this paper, an approach is presented that performs path planning via checkpoint and  dynamic  priority  assignment  using  statistical estimates of the environment\u2019s motion structure.  Additionally, they explore the issue of vision-based surveillance to track multiple moving objects in a cluttered scene.  The results of their approaches are illustrated using a variety of experiments.</p><p>With  the  increased  interest  in  reconfigurable  robotics,  another important issue in motion coordination is the generation of cooperative gaits using modular robot systems.  The article in  this  issue  by  Shen,  Salemi,  and  Will,  entitled  \u201CHormone-Inspired Adaptive Communication and Distributed Control for CONRO Self-Reconfigurable Robots\u201D addresses some issues in motion coordination for reconfigurable robots, illustrating the achievement of gaits that include the caterpillar move, a legged walk, and a rolling track.</p><p>Formation control has  been a  popular topic of  multi-robot systems for many years.  The article by Fredslund and Mataric in this special issue, entitled \u201CA General Algorithm for Robot Formation Using Local Sensing and Minimal Communication\u201D, addresses  the  problem of  achieving formation controls  using only local sensing and interaction.   Their key idea is to have each  robot  maintain  another  specific  robot,  called  a friend, within its field of view,  at a desired viewing angle.   They illustrate the ability of this approach to produce a variety of formations, including diamond, triangle, arrowhead, wedge, and hexagon.  Their results are illustrated through experiments on physical and simulated robot teams.</p><p>An advancement in the analysis of motion coordination in multi-robot teams is the development of provable theorems that characterize the  cooperative performance of  team  formations under certain conditions.   The article by Das,  Fierro, Kumar, Ostrowski, Spletzer, and Taylor, entitled \u201CA Framework for Vision Based  Formation Control\u201D,  examines motion control by developing a novel framework for controlling and coordinating a group of nonholonomic mobile robots. Their approach allows robot teams to accomplish diverse tasks such as scouting and reconnaissance and distributed manipulation using vision based formation control.  They show how their approach guarantees stability and convergence in a wide range of tasks, and illustrate their results on a platform of three nonholonomic robots.  An additional article in this special issue by Ogren, Egerstedt, and Hu, entitled \u201CA Control Lyapunov Function Approach to Multi-Agent Coordination\u201D, addresses the class of multi-robot teams for  which  control  Lyapunov  functions  can  be  found.   Their results yield an abstract and theoretically sound coordination strategy for formation control in multi-robot teams.   Another paper in this special issue, entitled \u201CDecentralized Control of Cooperative  Robotic  Vehicles:   Theory  and  Application\u201D,  by Feddema, Lewis, and Schoenwald, describes how decentralized control theory can be used to analyze the motion coordination performance of multiple mobile robots.  They illustrate the results  of their theory through several examples of distribution motion coordination on physical robots performing applications such as perimeter security.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#IV.ARCHITECTURES,TASKALLOCATION,ANDCONTROL> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>A great deal of research in distributed robotics has focused on the development of architectures, task planning capabilities, and control. This research area addresses the issues of action selection, delegation of authority and control, the communication structure, heterogeneity versus homogeneity of robots, achieving coherence amidst local actions, resolution of conflicts, and other related issues. Each architecture that has been developed for  multi-robot teams  tends  to  focus  on  providing a  specific type of capability to the distributed robot team.   Capabilities that have been of particular emphasis include task planning [1], fault tolerance [52], swarm control [45], human design of mission plans [42], role assignment [62], [22], [50], and so forth.</p><p>The article entitled \u201CPerformance of a  Distributed Robotic Systems Using Shared Communications Channels\u201D, by Rybski, Stoeter, Gini, Hougen, and Papanikolopoulos, presents a software architecture for the control of a set of miniature robots, called Scouts. The architecture for this system is constrained by the limited computational capabilities of the miniature robots, leading to a proxy-processing scheme enabling robots to use remote computers for their computing needs.  They present a resource allocation system that dynamically assigns resources to each robot to maximize the utilization of resources while also maintaining given behavior priorities. They present experimental results of their approach using their Scout robot team.</p><p>The architecture design challenge is  also addressed in this special issue in the article by Nakamura, Ota, and Arai, entitled \u201CHuman-Supervised Multiple Mobile Robot System\u201D. This article presents a flexible command and monitoring structure that enables a human operator to work with a team of mobile robots.</p><p>Four levels of control are defined, including the robot control level, the group level, the object control level, and the task control level. The effectiveness of their approach is illustrated in a transportation task using several mobile robots.</p><p>Another article in this special issue, entitled \u201CEmotion-Based Control  of  Cooperating  Heterogeneous  Mobile  Robots\u201D,  by Murphy, Lisetti, Irish, Tardif, and Gage, presents a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture that uses a computational model of emotions to modify active behaviors at the sensory-motor level and change the set of active behaviors at the schematic level.</p><p>The emotion-based control enables the team to demonstrate the desired societal behavior without any centralized planning and with minimal communication.  They illustrate their results on physical robots operating in public venues.</p><p>The task allocation issue is also addressed in the article entitled  \u201CSold!:  Market Methods for Multi-Robot Control\u201D,  by Gerkey and Mataric.  This article presents an approach for dynamic task allocation using a resource-centric negotiation strategy to produce a distributed approximation to a global optimum of resource usage.  They present validations of their approach in physical robot experiments in object pushing and in loosely-coupled task selection.</p><p>The article by Miyata, Ota, Arai, and Asama, entitled \u201CCooperative Transport by Multiple Mobile Robots in Unknown Static Environments  Associated  with  Real-time  Task-Assignment\u201D, addresses  the  development of  a  task  assignment  architecture for multiple mobile robots.   The architecture deals with multiple tasks that must be accomplished in real-time, in applications that consist of a large number of tasks relative to the number of available robots. They present an approach that involves two real-time planners:  a priority-based task-assignment planner and a motion planner.  They illustrate their approach in a cooperative transport task in simulation.</p><p>Vidal, Shakernia, Kim, Shim, and Sastry address multi-agent control architectures for teams of ground and aerial vehicles in their article entitled \u201CMulti-Agent Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games with Unmanned Ground and Aerial Vehicles\u201D. The goal of their research is the integration of multiple autonomous heterogeneous robots into a coordinated system that is modular, scalable, fault tolerant, adaptive, and efficient.  They present a hybrid hierarchical system architecture that segments the control of each agent into different layers of abstraction. These layers of abstraction allow interoperability in heterogeneous robot teams.   They illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in a pursuit-evasion application.</p><p>The  architecture,  task  allocation,  and  control  issue  is  addressed  by  the  article  entitled  \u201CCS  Freiburg:   Coordinating Robots for Successful Soccer Playing\u201D, by Weigel, Gutmann, Dietl,  Kleiner,  and  Nebel.</p><p>This  article  presents  a  multiagent coordination architecture to enable robot teams to play RoboCup soccer.  They use role assignments and an action selection module based on extended behavior networks to enable robots to cooperate in this domain. They present results of their approach from their RoboCup soccer experiences.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#I.INTRODUCTION> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>THE field of distributed robotics has its origins in the late 1980s, when several researchers began investigating issues in multiple mobile robot systems.  Prior to this time, research had concentrated on either single robot systems or distributed problem-solving systems that did not involve robotic components.  The topics of particular interest in this early distributed robotics work include: </p><ul><li><p>Cellular  (or  reconfigurable)  robot  systems,  such  as  the work by Fukuda, et al. [32] on the Cellular Robotic System  (CEBOT)  and  the  work  on  cyclic  swarms  by  Beni [18],</p></li><li><p>Multi-robot  motion  planning,  such  as  the  work  by  Premvuti  and  Yuta  [55]  on  traffic  control and  the  work  on movement in formations by Arai, et al. [2] and Wang [66], and Architectures  for  multi-robot  cooperation,  such  as  the work on ACTRESS by Asama, et al. [12].</p></li></ul><p>Since this early research in distributed mobile robotics, the field has grown dramatically, with a much wider variety of topics being addressed. Collections of research in this area include the edited volumes by Balch and Parker [15] and Schultz and Parker [59], as well as the series of proceedings from the Symposia  on  Distributed  Autonomous  Robotic  Systems  (DARS) [8], [10], [11], [40], [54], [9].  Additionally, previous special journal issues have addressed the topic of multi-robot systems; two of particular interest have been published by the journal Autonomous Robots \u2013 a special issue on Robot Colonies [4], and another on  Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems  [14].   However, a significant amount of new research has been achieved since these previous special issues, and thus this current special issue discusses many new developments in the field since these earlier publications.</p><p>Several  new  robotics  application  areas,  such  as  underwater  and  space  exploration,  hazardous  environments,  service robotics in both public and private domains, the entertainment field, and so forth, can benefit from the use of multi-robot systems.   In  these  challenging application  domains,  multi-robot systems can often deal with tasks that are difficult, if not impossible, to be accomplished by an individual robot.  A team of robots may provide redundancy and contribute cooperatively to solve the assigned task,  or they may perform the assigned task in a more reliable, faster, or cheaper way beyond what is possible with single robots.</p><p>The field of cooperative autonomous mobile robotics is still new enough that no topic area within this domain can be considered mature. Some areas have been explored more extensively, however, and the community is beginning to understand how to develop and control certain aspects of multi-robot teams.  For example, the issue of balancing reactivity and social deliberation has  been considered for both simulated and real multi-agent systems in the collection of papers edited by Hannebauer, Wendler, and Pagello [33]. Rather than to try to summarize the research articles in this special issue into a taxonomy of cooperative systems (see Dudek [29] and Cao [23] for previous related summaries), we instead organize this research by the principal topic areas that have generated significant levels of study, to the extent possible in a limited space.   The seven principle topic areas of Multi-Robot Systems that we have identified are:</p><ul><li><p>Biological Inspirations;</p></li><li><p>Communication;</p></li><li><p>Architectures, task allocation, and control;</p></li><li><p>Localization, mapping, and exploration;</p></li><li><p>Object transport and manipulation;</p></li><li><p>Motion coordination; and</p></li><li><p>Reconfigurable robots.</p></li></ul><p>Many of the articles in this special issue address more than one of these foundational problems in multi-robot systems. We therefore describe aspects of these articles as they apply to each of these key research areas.  For context, we also discuss other key references and examples of prior research in each of these principle topic areas as we introduce this special issue.  However, space does not allow an exhaustive treatment of each of these important research areas, and thus we cannot throughly review all the previous literature pertinent to this subject.  We conclude this editorial by suggesting additional research issues that  have  not  yet  been  extensively  studied,  but  appear  to  be of growing interest and need in distributed autonomous multi-robot systems.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
