<http://www.dc4plus.com/references/rdf_sem.html#1Introduction> <http://schema.org/description> "\n			                <p>A text\u2019s style can affect our cognitive responses and attitudes, thereby influencing behavior (Spence, 1983; Van Laer et al., 2013). The predictive relationship between language and behavior has been well studied in applications of NLP to \u2217This work was conducted while the first author was doing internship at Google. 1Our code is available at github.com/rpryzant/ deconfounded_lexicon_induction/tree/ master/text-performance-attribution tasks like linking text to sales figures (Ho and Wu, 1999; Pryzant et al., 2017) and voter preference (Luntz, 2007; Ansolabehere and Iyengar, 1995). In this paper, we are interested in interpreting rather than predicting the relationship between language and behavior. We focus on a specific instance: the relationship between the way a search advertisement is written and internet user behavior as measured by click through rate (CTR). In this study CTR is the ratio of clicks to impressions over a 90-day period, i.e. the probability of a click, given the person saw the ad. Our goal is to develop a method for performance attribution in textual advertisements: identifying lexical features (words, phrases, etc.) to which we can attribute the success (or failure) of a search ad, regardless of who created the advertisement or what it is selling. Identifying linguistic features that are associated with various outcomes is a common activity among machine learning scientists and practitioners. Indeed, it is essential for developing transparent and interpretable machine learning NLP models (Yamamoto, 2012). However, the various forms of regression and association quantifiers like mutual information or log-odds ratio that are the de-facto standard for feature weighting and text attribution all have known drawbacks, largely related to problems of multicollinearity (Imai and Kim, 2016; Gelman and Loken, 2014; Wurm and Fisicaro, 2014; Estevez et al. \u00B4 , 2009; Szumilas, 2010). Furthermore, these prior methods of text attribution critically fail to disentangle the explanatory power of the text from that of confounding information which could also explain the outcome. For example, in movie reviews, the actors who star in a film are the most powerful predictors of box of- fice success (Joshi et al., 2010). However, these are words that the film\u2019s marketers can\u2019t change. Likewise, the name of a well-known brand in an ad for shoes might boost its effectiveness, but if we attribute the ad\u2019s success to the brand terms, we are actually crediting the power of the brand, not necessarily an actionable writing strategy (Ghose and Sundararajan, 2006). There is an emerging line of work on text understanding for confound-controlled settings (Johansson et al., 2016; Egami et al., 2017; Pryzant et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), but these methods are usually concerned with making causal inferences using text. They are limited to word-features and can only tell you whether a word is discriminative. Attribution involves the more fine-grained problem of identifying discriminative subsequences of the text and being able to explain which level of the outcome these subsequences support. We present a pair of new algorithms for solving this problem. Based on the Adversarial and Residualizing models of (Pryzant et al., 2018), these algorithms first train a machine learning model and then analyze the trained parameters on strategically chosen inputs to infer the most important features for each output class. Our first algorithm encodes the text with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and proceeds to predict the outcome and adversarially predict the confounders. We select attributional n-grams by projecting back the weights of the output layer onto the encoder\u2019s convolutional feature maps. Our second algorithm uses a bag-of-words text representation and is trained to learn the part of the text\u2019s effect that the confounds cannot explain. We get n-grams from this method by tracing back the contribution of each feature towards each outcome class. We demonstrate these algorithms\u2019 efficacy by conducting attribution studies on high- and lowperforming search advertisements across three domains: real estate, job listings, and apparel. We find the proposed algorithms lend importance to words that are more predictive and less confoundrelated than a variety of strong baselines. </p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .

This paper presents two methods for performance attribution: finding the degree to which an outcome can be attributed to parts of a text while controlling for potential confounders1 . Both algorithms are based on interpreting the behaviors and parameters of trained neural networks. One method uses a CNN to encode the text, an adversarial objective function to control for confounders, and projects its weights onto its activations to interpret the importance of each phrase towards each output class. The other method leverages residualization to control for confounds and performs interpretation by aggregating over learned word vectors. We demonstrate these algorithms\u2019 ef- ficacy on 118,000 internet search advertisements and outcomes, finding language indicative of high and low click through rate (CTR) regardless of who the ad is by or what it is for. Our results suggest the proposed algorithms are high performance and data efficient, able to glean actionable insights from fewer than 10,000 data points. We find that quick, easy, and authoritative language is associated with success, while lackluster embellishment is related to failure. These findings agree with the advertising industry\u2019s emperical wisdom, automatically revealing insights which previously required manual A/B testing to discover.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> .
