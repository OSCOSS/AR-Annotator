2.swj1257.pdf   RODI: Benchmarking Relational-to-Ontology Mapping Generation Quality

in Section 2.1 "Naming Conflicts" I believe that some of the challenges you claim to be unique to the relational-to-ontology context (singular vs. plural names, different tokenization) do actually also exist in other contexts such as ontology alignment.

* Table 1: It is not clear to me how something as unspecific as an instance of owl:Class can provide _guidance_ to a mapping creator.


* 4.1 "Overview":
* Table 2 The first 3 columns reproduce table 1, which wastes space. Think of a better way of arranging this information.

I would not count this as a contribution of a scientific paper.

I don't really agree that this would cover all issues of multi-source integration. Things like multiple resources referring to the same real-world individuals, or violations of disjoint class axioms could be introduced without being noticed that way.

--> 'is vital (e.g., [17]). In order to help ontology-based'


Section 4.3 
“Geodata domain has been designed as a medium-sized case” → What does it mean medium size?

- Sounds a bit odd to me. (Would have expected a passive like 'important to be tested under real-world challenges'.)
