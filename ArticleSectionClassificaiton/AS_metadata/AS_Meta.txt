word2vec gives a similariy of 0.491431 METHODS and  METHODOLOGY
but gave similary of 0.78211 for car and vehicle. So is not reliable without lemisation. but lemissation creates problem:

Classification Problems:
1.word similarity does not give us proper classification. Validity and validations are two different subjects.

2.One section can be included in two classes. There is not a direct mapping of words to classes.
motivation some times is included in introduction. In some papers it has its own section.
Discussion and results can be together or seperated. Or background is usually part of the Introduction, but may be present as separated section.

Therefore we created an ontology of Article Sections with AS_ID for the training data based on DEO ontology


false labels, we use them beside each of the none related keywords as flase labels.
